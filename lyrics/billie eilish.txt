​lovely Lyrics
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & 
Khalid
]
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (
Found
)
But you never go away (
Never go away
)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
[Chorus: Billie Eilish 
with Khalid
]
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
[Verse 2: Khalid 
with Billie Eilish
]
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

​when the party’s over Lyrics
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

Happier Than Ever Lyrics
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You might also like
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah
 

​bad guy Lyrics
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy

I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

​everything i wanted Lyrics
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly 
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
You might also like
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

​idontwannabeyouanymore Lyrics
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
You might also like
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

​bury a friend Lyrics
Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & 
Mehki Raine
]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

Mehki Raine
]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
[Bridge: Billie Eilish & 
Mehki Raine
]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

​i love you Lyrics
It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
You might also like
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Your Power Lyrics
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know 
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes 
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
You might also like
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? 
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know 
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain
Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

​wish you were gay Lyrics
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say 
(
Aww
)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away
 
(
Hahahahahahahaha
)
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" 
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(
Yay
)
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
You might also like
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

No Time To Die Lyrics
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
You might also like
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

​​ocean eyes Lyrics
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes 
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Therefore I Am Lyrics
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn

I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable 
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man

​my future Lyrics
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I , I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now 
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone 
But aren't I someone? 
I'd  like to be your answer 
'Cause you're so handsome 
You might also like
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I , I'm in love 
With my future
And you don't know her 
And I, I'm in love 
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years

​all the good girls go to hell Lyrics
My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
You might also like
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell 
'Cause even God herself  has enemies
And once the water starts to rise 
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake

​you should see me in a crown Lyrics
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse

You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"

Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

​xanny Lyrics
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(
And it's like, wait, like, when?
)
Wakin' up at sundown 
They're late to every party 
Nobody's ever sorry 
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down 
Their pretty heads are hurting 
They're awfully bad at learning 
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance
You might also like
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting

​bellyache Lyrics
Mind
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
You might also like
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

​ilomilo Lyrics
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life
Hurry, I'm worried
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
You might also like
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to
Hurry, I'm worried
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

​listen before i go Lyrics
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do 
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out 
But down
Hmm, down
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a 
year-long headache
 does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu 
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon
You might also like
Sorry can't save me now 
Sorry I don't know how 
Sorry there's no way out 
But down
Hmm, down
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

​my strange addiction Lyrics
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
You might also like
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it 
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
Bite my glass
, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?

COPYCAT Lyrics
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
You might also like
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

​hostage Lyrics
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
You might also like
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage
Like a hostage

What Was I Made For? Lyrics
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?
You might also like
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

​watch Lyrics
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
You might also like
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back

Six Feet Under Lyrics
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
You might also like
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom, bloom again
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

​my boy Lyrics
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
(
What?
)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (
Who are you?
)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye

NDA Lyrics
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? 
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen 
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year 
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе 
Maybе I should think about a new career 
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth 
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
You might also like
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars

8 Lyrics
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Oh, hmm, hmm
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm

You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Oh, hmm, hmm
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

​bitches broken hearts Lyrics
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine 
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind
 
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care

But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging

​​come out and play Lyrics
Hmm-mm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

​​party favor Lyrics
Hey, leave a message
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday

Male Fantasy Lyrics
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how

Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you

​goodbye Lyrics
Please, please
Don't leave﻿ me
Be
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go ﻿to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?

6.18.18 Lyrics
Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know
I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time
You might also like
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know-oh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th hell to pay
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know
You will never know

Billie Bossa Nova Lyrics
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Da-da-da-da
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts 
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
You better lock your phone 
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' 
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know
You might also like
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression 
Nobody saw me in the lobby 
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm 
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like 
You better lock your phone 
And look at me when you're alone 
Won't take a lot to get you goin' 
I'm sorry if it's torture though 
I know, I know
You better lock your door 
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for 
That heavy breathin' on the floor 
I'm yours, I'm yours 
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental

Oxytocin Lyrics
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday, could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
I wanna do bad things to you 
I wanna make you yell 
I wanna do bad things to you 
Don't wanna treat you well 
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know 
I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving
You might also like
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved

You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away
Bad things
To you
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well

Halley’s Comet Lyrics
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3 AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you

I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
What am I to do?

Getting Older Lyrics
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before 
Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored 
Now we're estranged
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
You might also like
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm 
 To be abused, mmm
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time

The 30th Lyrics
Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

What if it happened to you on a different day?
On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?
Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In your hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so am I

TV Lyrics
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on 
Survivor
 just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
And you tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem

Lost Cause Lyrics
Something's in the—
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time 
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you 
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong 
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job 
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

I used to think you were shy 
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine 
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
 So easy 
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong 
You ain't nothing but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothing like it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw 
But you got no job 
You ain't nothing but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothing like it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw 
But you got no job

Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm

Would I, could I, make you happy?
So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me
If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agreed
I was and you were happy

I Didn’t Change My Number Lyrics
Okay
Mm-mm, I
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset 
You're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes 
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't dеserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so

Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart"

And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart

Better keep your head down-down

Not My Responsibility Lyrics
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?

WHEN I WAS OLDER Lyrics
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood

Everybody Dies Lyrics
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown

Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
, seven days in limbo
Seven days
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Happier Than Ever  Lyrics
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I’m wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin’ friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin’ sad
So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah

Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me?
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through

​another stupid song Lyrics
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
I never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts, you treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure, you're never really sure
Boy, you never listen
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
Time to come to terms, put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh

Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient
And know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning
But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying
Walking up the hill tonight

And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said use your hands and my spare time
We’ve got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway
There’s only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no

Or could I easily fill his shoes?

You all got boyfriends anyway

From me
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned
Mmm
Mmm
Twist my words and then wring 'em out
Drag me down into your jealousy
Rising to inside your open mouth
Taking out your whole life on me
On me
You might also like
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned
Don't tell me to come home, you must be stoned
Won't be wrapped up in your wings that spread with disaster
No, I'm not all those things you might be after
Maybe you're just too stoned to see you're the reason I don't come home
Too faded to see that my heart's growin' blacker
You burn all your dirty laundry
You curse at your phone
You set the house on fire and tell me to come home
Tell me you're stoned

I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go

Lyrics from Snippet
Strange
Boy, you're acting shady ...

You were from the North, I was from the South
We were from opposite places, different towns
But I knew it was good and you knew it was too
So we moved together like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the same
It was real, and the shadows grew
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
I would've shouted loud and broken through
I would've given it all to belong to you
But there were different plans, different rules
You said "where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show you the way to the rest of my sins"
Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
Yeah I should know
Yeah you, you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
Yeah I should know
For I'm your secret aren't I babe?
Yeah I'm your secret aren't I babe?
Aren't I babe?



Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Da, da da da, da da da da
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
You might also like
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight 
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of town
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn

Now you know
Now I'm free
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Never let you burn
Let you burn, let you burn
Never gonna let you burn
Let you burn

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses...
Could roses...
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

Let's take a ride downtown





Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you'rе gonna die, not by mistake

I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

Thought I found a way out (

But you never go away (

So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
[Chorus: Billie Eilish 
with Khalid
]
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Tear, tear
Tear my abyss in half
Tear, yeah
Tear mе to pieces, begging and plеading
Kill me if needed
Chip on my 
shoulder
 right next to my demons
I'm the one stressing, curse with a blessing
Heart full of weapons…

I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him?
And does he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic loud
Try as I may, it doesn't last
And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's nеver to become
For I am not thе one

I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair

Would you still... something else
If I can't return your corpse
No, I'm still involved

Can't you see?
He hurt her
How do you breathe
Without me?
How do you see me?

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
End me

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son

I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious

Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how

Mmm, down
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you

When I'm away from you
I’m happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin’ you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know
When I’m away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn’t true, mm-mm

You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
’Cause you only listen to your f***** friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this s*****
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk s*** about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that s***'s embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me f*****' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just f****** leave me alone, yeah 

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate

Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I’ll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you’d fall apart
'Cause I’m too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now 
Calling security, keepin’ my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?

Lyrics from Snippet
I always thought the way you talked was neat
And I dreamed that when you'd speak you'd speak to me, mm
But you're always out of reach
And I can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet
I'll wanna touch you
I'll wanna touch you, ooh
...

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses...
Could roses...
Could roses...
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses...

Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds

I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom



Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

Hate to be the one that told you so

You've run out of time

Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry

Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once 
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, all I see is him right now
H-h-him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn

But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake

Packing everything when you leave

But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of aorta
And I'll watch your car burn

We lay all day in our comfy bed, what a wonderful life
We play outside in the green grass, what a wonderful life
We smell all the roses in the rose bush, what a wonderful life

Got a mood that you wish you could sell

There'd be swimming pools filled by models

Would you break it, if you're honest?

Mmm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, hmm
Quiet, mmm
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, hmm
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, and feel the wind blow

I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
When you're with me and we're alone

Maybe that's the reason I love you, you
I know you too well
But you say it so good, hmm

Starstruck, and blind
Now, I know where you might find
Too sweet
Put it together and go

"Happier Than Ever"! Probably the most therapeutic song I've ever written or recorded? Like, ever, ever, ever? 'Cause I just screamed my lungs out and could barely talk afterwards which was very satisfying to me somehow? I had wanted to get those screams out for a very long time. And it was very nice, too.

"Baby, I don't feel so good"
Six words you never understood
"I'll never get you go"
Five words you never say
I laugh along like nothing's wrong
Four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two is us
One slipped away
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is walk the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a twelve step just for you?

Eleven "heys" 
Ten fingers pulling out my hair
Ninе times you never madе it there

Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

Somewhere in her smile she knows

Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now

You're asking me will my love grow

Welcome, it's Billie, and this is Happier Than Ever, the first time I am doing my album all in one back to back, so, I'm Billie
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before 
Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I rеalized I crave pity
When I rеtell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored 
Now we're estranged
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of

'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm

Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of

So I just wanted to say something real quick, which is yesterday I was at Kimmel, which was amazing, and when I left I had to go to a rehearsal. So to walk to the car, there was an alley that I walked through. Like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans, and then like 500 feet to my right was what I thought was fans and paparazzi.
I started, I went to the left side. I walked all the way over to them and hugged them all, I took pictures and talked to them for a second. Didn't sign anything, because I like don't do that. That's something I don't do, because I used to and I realised all anyone did was sell everything that I signed so I stopped doing that. It's kind of a policy of mine that I don't.
So I talked to them, hugged them all, I went to the other side and as I got closer, like they were cheering for me and stuff, and shouting for my name and stuff, and so I walked.
And as I got closer, I kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers, which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all.
But I didn't want to like be disrespectful at all, so I went up to them all and I like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever, and I started to do that. Nobody put their hands out. Nobody tried to hug me back...I hugged one girl at the end, and so she was really sweet...
But then I tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were, not where the first group was, but like in the same area that I was in, because I thought that's where there were fans.
When I looked over there, they were gone. And I was like, OK well, I guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph, which I don't do because these bitches will sell that shit.
Like, I'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever, of course I'm gonna do that. But I have this whole thing about not signing things because I just want to be there. I'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit.
I don't do that, and I've tried to make that clear like a billion times,  and I said it before I went over to them.
Anyway.
I started to walk away, because I realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person. Um, and so I walked away.
As I started to walk away back to the car, they all started to boo me.
And then they all started calling me a little bitch, and saying I'm gonna lose my Grammy nominations, and you know, what a little fucking you know, whatever, just cursing me out and shit.
Damn, dude, like...
Then I started hearing them comparing, they kept being like, "Lorde would have stopped". I'm like, I did stop! I walked 500 fe- I walked like 1,000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch?
Like, the fact that people can switch up like that ...damn. Like wait outside for you, and then immediately they don't get what they want, and they boo you and fucking curse at you.
I'm like, "Bro, I'm 17! You're ..." Oh my God, this shit is...! I turned around ready to fucking pounce, and then I got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction, which is probably good, and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but...
Mm...anyway, the only reason I'm making this video is because I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened. Because if you watch the video it literally looks like I'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them, which is not at all what happened.
I literally walked from the other side of the alley, which was like 1,000 feet. Which is fine, I'm like happy to do it. But I walked over there literally only to say hi, only to hug people. I literally went over and I was like, "I don't want pictures, I want to hug", and I got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face. And no love whatsoever.
So I left and then I got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that I'm gonna lose my Grammys.
I probably am gonna lose the Grammys, but it's okay though! I'm not worried about that, it's the nomination that counts!
Anyway! I don't know, I just wanted to, I don't even know...I went back to the other side where the real fans were and I was like, "Guys they booed me!" And they were very sweet. You guys are my friends, I love you a lot.
And to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch, I hope the best for you. I hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle. So yeah, all the best!
Love you paparazzi.

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night, then tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no
I'm the one that made you rich when I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us, so I guess that don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours any night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah that we was barely speakin'
All this kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me
You missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me we should let it go and put it all behind us
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk, then why you callin', huh?
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
Baby how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that



Try'na find the key
Try'na find the key, locked me out
Don't look away from me
Don't look away from me, don't say calm down
I cried sorry
I cried sorry for everything
I thought I did you wrong
I thought I did you wrong but I didn't
Shame on you, shame on you
Try'na play me twice the fool
Shame on me, shame on me
For every lie that I believed
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
But I'm not crazy, just through
The silly little girl like you
Knocking on your door
Knocking on your door got my knuckles bruised
Can't take it no more
Can't take it no more, I just want the truth

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Na-na-na
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information’s not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts 
I'm not sentimental
But there’s somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
You better lock your phone 
And look at me when you're alone
Won't take a lot to get you goin' 
I'm sorry if it’s torture though
I know, I know
You might also like
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression 
Nobody saw me in the lobby 
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm
I’m not sentimental
But there's somethin’ 'bout the way you look tonight, mm 
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I’m the only one who does it how you like 
You better lock your phone 
And look at me when you're alone 
Won't take a lot to get you goin' 
I'm sorry if it's torture though 
I know, I know
You better lock your door 
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for 
That heavy breathin' on the floor 
I'm yours, I'm yours 
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental

Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with -
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high

Lyrics From Snippet
One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Again?
Again?
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Again?

Let it happen
I can't let it happen again
'Cause you'll find out s—
What was it? The—
 find out
That's right!
Find out soon enough
Nananananana
I know now, you know how

I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you
You might also like
I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love



I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
You might also like
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
You should see me in a crown
You might also like
You should see me in a crown
You should see me in a crown
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse 
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
You should see me in a crown
You should see me in a crown

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You might also like
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your little friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this badly
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that's just embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me feel so sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Why can't you leave me alone, yeah

Um... "GOLDWING", I... wrote a song that is kind of a metaphor for, you know, a young woman, especially in the industry, or in... you know, life, that is pure, and I don't mean 
a virgin





Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I’ll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
I’ll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I’m free
I’ll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me

"Therefore I Am"...  it's funny, I've recently seen people talk about who they think it's about and I'm like "what are you talking about?" It's actually not about anybody I know, it's not about anybody that I've ever had a friendship or a relationship with, it's about people, types of people, and... yeah, I don't know, it's like, I'm not really gonna talk about what it's actually about, 
but

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?



Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? 
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen 
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' s*** to say, oh-oh
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year 
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here 
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number
, made him shut his mouth 
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up

Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars

Okay
Mm-mm, I
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset 
You're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes 
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of - nerve
I don't deserve, so

We took the production from "Not My Responsibility" and made it into a beat, and then wrote "OverHeated", and it's really just about the same thing, y'know, why the fuck is it such a shock that I look like 
all of you

Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?





Something's in the—
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time 
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you 
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your s*** together, but damn, I was wrong 
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job 
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You might also like
I used to think you were shy 
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine 
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
 So easy 
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong 
You ain't nothing but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothing like it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw 
But you got no job 
You ain't nothing but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothing like it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw 
But you got no job

"Your Power". For me this is a... very personal meaning. I don't wanna talk about it but, um... you know, it was pretty sad when it came out and so many people came to me saying "thank you for this song," it's crazy. I don't know 
one

Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know 
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes 
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
You might also like
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? 
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know 
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power

Seeing the dress, seeing your face
Darken your inner self, we made our lives last longer
Hey, this is the best damn thing in town
Money MIA, can't buy yourself new rings like the other girls
No prom, nothing for me
I always used to get so jealous of the girls at school
Now I don't have to
Look at me now mama
I'm doing everything you wanted me too
I've got everything I wanted
Now I can go back
Let's play some hide and seek
I'll count to three
You can maybe make it out alive
Hurtful words are said
So ask them to play somе hide and seek
Practicing the piano might be confusing
Got my chеck for work
Don't have to brag, I have more than you
Used to have a lover but you took him from me

Hurtful words are said
So ask them to play some hide and seek
Meet Cinderella, she'll do acapella
She even has a new friend named Bella
Who has another friend named Ella
They can't get enough of each other
I will wait forever until they disappear evermore
Wait for the sun to come down
Wait for the dark to rise
Missing out on everything
Missing out on yourself

Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown

I can't seem to focus
And you don’t seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection’s all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I , I’m in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I’m lonely now 
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone 
But aren’t I someone? 
I'd  like to be your answer 
’Cause you're so handsome 
You might also like
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I , I'm in love 
With my future
And you don't know her 
And I, I'm in love 
But not with anybody here

Aah
Aah
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Aah
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? 
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Actual people that like, liked me in here, I don't know why. Like, I don't know why. I don't know. So, I hope you know it makes me very happy to—ooh—it makes me very happy to hear—see that you guys are here. I love all your faces. You look very pretty, you look very cute. Alright, alright, okay, here we go. We're really going for real, okay
Mmm, all the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
Standing there, killing time
I can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise

Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
Sing it, woo 
'Cause even God herself, mm, has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team, mm
And my Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
And my god is gonna owe me



I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

Sometimes They Do Lyrics
Keep your friends close
Keep your enemies closer
I bet that's what they told her
Words don't break bones
And telling me it's over
Won't put me in a coma
I've had too many dreams of losing you
When we fall out and you find someone new
I'd wake up wishing dreams never come true
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Call when I'm gone
You're way too into goners
I bet that's why you want her
You read the stars wrong
It's over and you know it
Don't try to sugarcoat it
I've had too many dreams of losing you
When we fall out and you find someone new
I'd wake up wishing dreams never come true
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do

When we fall out and you find someone new
I'd wake up wishing dreams never come true
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
Sometimes they do
I've had too many dreams of losing you
When we fall out and you find someone new
I'd wake up wishing dreams never come true
Sometimes they do

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really , how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' 
I started walkin' , gave no reaction
No reaction
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
I don't really wanna know why it went there 
I kinda don't care 
You wanna kill me? 
You wanna hurt me? 
Stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
That I really look just like the rest of you

And everybody said it was a letdown
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
 Am I?
All these other inanimate -, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated

Ricky Remedy, yeah
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

You said forever, now I drive alone past your street
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & 
Billie Eilish
]
No fair
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe 
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & 
Billie Eilish

You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes

I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

Watch me make 'em bow

You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here

Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
Those ocean eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
Those ocean eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those eyes
When you give me those, give me those, give me those eyes

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
You might also like
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage

Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine

Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse

You say, "Come over, baby

Watch me make 'em bow

You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow

You should see me in a crown 
Your silence is my favorite sound 
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one

Followed your footsteps, fell over the edge
Fighting the free fall woke up in my bed
But then I remember the last thing you said
Put my mouth to the mirror and whispered
"You're dead"
Friends, just friends
Oh, we could've been, oh, we should've been
More than just friends, best friends
I'm not looking for, don't need anymore
What's so special 'bout you 
Special 'bout you 
Carved out a crater in the back of my mind
You captured my thoughts, keep me preoccupied
But there's always a stranger sitting on your other side
I'm just wondering how you sleep at night
It's like a movie that I've seen too many times
I memorize every stupid line
The way you call her names to make her realize
I'll change the end, let the hero die

Thank ya. Alright, um, the next one we're gonna play is-is very long and very sad. So, I don't know if you wanna, like, sit down on the floor, or some shit? I don't know if that's even possible, don't worry about it. Anyway, just relax, think about whatever you wanna think about. Um, just-just let this one be like one you don't worry about anything, yes? Okay.​
It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do? Mm
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Mmm-mm-mm-mm
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make mе laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I lovе you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Mmm-mm-mm-mm

Even when you felt like dying
Do-do-do
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Woo, I love the energy in here
Mmm, mm-mm, da-da-da
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyеs

Hey, leave a message
Hey - call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait - you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday

You hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"

That's right, alright. Oh, we back. Okay, you ready for this next one? I'm ready. Y'all it is fall, it is November, it is going to be December soon and it's time for this one to come back
Mm-mmm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Quiet, mm
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet
Hmm-mm
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promisе you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kеpt inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
You might also like
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home and feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence, mm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away

Thank you, tee-hee-hee
Ah, this is a—an oldie, mm
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Da-na-na-na-na
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistakе
Only you know the way that I break, uh
You might also like
If teardrops could bе bottled

Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you

Da-da-da-da-da, you must know this song
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that sad—what? Hahahaha
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Uh, duh
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
I'm the sad type, what?
Uh, mm
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
You might also like
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the mеn I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't gеt enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
Ba-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da, uh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? 
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen 
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh
You ready to sing this part
Sing
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year 
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here 
Maybe I should think about a new career 
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth 
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
Sing with me everybody

You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars

This is my last song London
I love you so much, thank you for having me
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clеarly weren't aware that you madе me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin'-
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
Sing
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah 
Thank you London
Goodnight

Ooh, mm
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold

Sorry I'm the one that told you so

Uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak

Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you

Lyrics from Snippet

Strange
Boy you're acting shady
...

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
You might also like
They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again
Help, I lost myself again

You made me hate this city

Thank you. Okay, so I'ma do one more song and then I'm gonna go. But, um, I wanna thank you guys for coming and listening. Um, and, uh,  thank you so much to Jack White for having us and here being a boss, um, and-and inspiring a whole generation of people to do what they want. Um, and this place is so cool, it's like such an honor to get to be here and to do this. It's like the coolest thing ever. Do you see that? They're like making my voice onto a thing, like, that's crazy. Like, right now, it's crazy, heh. Um, so for this last one, um all I say—all I wanna say and all I ask is that just we all to just try to be, um, just try to be, um, just happy that we're alive and happy that we're breathing and that we're here and we're safe and, um, that's pretty much it. Just be—just for us to all be grateful that we're here right now on this Earth. Um, yeah, so thank you for having me. Let's do it. And thank you so much for giving me the energy you've been giving me
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer, call me back
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue, ahh
Bury a friend, try to wake up, ahh

But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now, wow
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close

Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? 
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, uh
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' sh** to say, ay-ay-oh
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-ee

I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе 
Maybе I should think about a new career

Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth 
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about

How'd it get so dark?

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gonе blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature madе friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

I had a dream 
I got everything I wanted 
Not what you'd think 
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care 
Thought I could fly 
So I stepped off the golden, mm 
Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted 
But when I wake up I see
You with me 
And you say
"As long as I'm here no-one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I can change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you."

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago 
But I don't wanna let anybody know 
Cause everybody wants something from me now 
And I don't wanna let 'em down 
I had a dream 
I got everything I wanted 
But when I wake up I see 
You with me

"As long as I'm here no-one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I can change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you." 
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then would I do it again, 
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

London, how you feeling?
Mm-mm, I
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset
Haha, you're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes

Love you
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
And if "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you, ahh-ahh-ahh
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night 
Need a place to hidе, but 
Wanna feel alive, outsidе

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

Please, please
Don't leave﻿ me
Be
It’s not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I’m no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go ﻿to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?
I'm the bad guy

Mind
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Let's go
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
C'mon
Maybe it's in the-

You really know how to make me cry

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, ahh
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
You might also like
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
That I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to"
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she rеads all the lyrics
She'll pity the mеn I know

I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy

I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it

I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really , how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' 
I started walkin' , gave no reaction
No reaction

Can't be deleted, can't un-believе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
And I don't really wanna know why it went there 
I kinda don't care 
You wanna kill me? 
You wanna hurt me? 
Stop bein' flirty

But did you really think "This is the right thing to do"?

I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it

Where my good girls at?
My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
, An open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya-ahh

'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to risе

Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

I'm getting older, I think I'm aging well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door
Relax
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer

Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

When I'm away from you
I’m happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin’ you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't awarе that you made me misеrable
So if you rеally wanna know

I'm happier than ever

'Cause I'd never treat me this sh—
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk - about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that ****'s embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me ******' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

You played the part

No wonder why you didn't ask

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (
Anyone before
)
Too bad they're usually deranged
[Verse 2: Live Billie Eilish,

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (
Lyin' for attention just to get neglection
)
Now we're estranged
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

You Inspector Gadget
I change my perspective
You got inconvenient
I change my direction
I feel like Mulan
I've seen my reflection
I'm tryin' to move on
I hear your objection
I see you addicted
You got an obsession
You misunderstood me
Common misconception
You overcommitted
You need to relax, man
Don't care 'bout your feelings
But I'm feeling sneaky

Eat dick, stop the chatter

Your bitch gobble-gobble like Pac-Man
Do what I want, you do what you can

Lied to the bitch 'bout fuckin' her friend 
Welp, I might as well fuck again

I have a crazy wedgie
Ha, ha, ha
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
Bounce with me a little
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wantеd to protect you
But now I'll never gеt to

Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
Here we go
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by

Relax
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could liе, say I like it like that, like it likе that
But nothin' is better sometimes

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

I should've known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life
But life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death, or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
There's just no time to die
There's just no time to die
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern mm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin' to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction

My doctors can't explain

But you are my strange addiction
I'm really, rеally sorry, I think I was just relieved

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
