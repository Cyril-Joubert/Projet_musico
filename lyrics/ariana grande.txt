​thank u, next Lyrics
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin'—
You might also like
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 
She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 
I've got so much love 
Got so much patience 
And I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next

7 rings Lyrics
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things 
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah 
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
You might also like
My smile is beamin' , my skin is gleamin' 
The way it shine, I know you've seen it 
I bought a crib just for  the closet 
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it 
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

​yes, and? Lyrics
In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on 
Come on and walk this way through the fire 
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like
"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"
Now, I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life
You might also like
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on 
Come on and walk this way through the fire 
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like
"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?" 
My tongue is sacred, I speak upon what I like
Protected, sexy, discerning with my time 
Your energy is yours and mine is mine 
What's mine is mine
My face is sitting, I don't need no disguise 
Don't comment on my body, do not reply
Your business is yours and mine is mine
Why do you care so much whose **** I ride?
Why?
"Yes, and?" 
Say that shit with your chest, and 
Be your own fuckin' best friend 
Say that shit with your chest

​pov Lyrics
It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way that you trust me 
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared 
Learnin' to be grateful for myself 
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
You might also like
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way that you trust me 
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely 
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh 
The way that you trust me, baby 
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view 
Yeah

​imagine Lyrics
Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never
Act this regular
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never
Thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits

Boyfriend Lyrics
I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love 
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove 
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too 
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah

​needy Lyrics
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot 
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish 
But after all this damage, I can’t help it 
But what you can trust is I need your touch

​ghostin Lyrics
I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time 
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell 
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

Don't want that living in your head

What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you 
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you, baby

Over him, mmh

​in my head Lyrics
Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm

​R.E.M. Lyrics
Mm-mm
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep 
You're such a dream to me, mm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe 
Mm, you're such a dream to me
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up , wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
You're like, "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real?

I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (
I know how to keep it

The Good Housekeeping Seal
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it 
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up

Dangerous Woman Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

NASA Lyrics
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
I'd rather be alone tonight 
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Ah, hmm-mmm

MONOPOLY Lyrics
Yeah
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

​better off Lyrics
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional , yeah
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition, I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

Die For You  Lyrics
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

​make up Lyrics
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin’ my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you

You know that I'm 'bout to wake up with you
I love it when we make up 
Go ’head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
My energy and attitude don't really coincide
I'm stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup

Boy, you know what it is
I love it when we make up 
Go ’head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Let me stay in my bag ’cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look, it’s a match
Attitude, dream of mine 
When you say that I'm right 
And I find that it works every time
And I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup

Understand, my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's, baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got ninety-nine problems, but you won't be one,

​fantasize Lyrics
Ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh, oh 
A few weeks ago
I saw you front row
And my heart stopped at the sight 
Thought you were solo 
But you got a girl though 
And my life ain't been the same
Been feelin'
Mentally, physically weak 
Boys blowin' up my phone 
They just ain't you, oh, baby
I'm meant to be on my own 
But just before I go 
There's something you should know
And boy, I
I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five
Five-to-nine
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of  way 
That just ain't me

A few months later
You're still togеther 
And you just can't tell mе why 
So, boy, stop pretendin' 
'Cause I won't keep waitin'
I'm out the door, bye, bye, bye 
Been feelin'
Mentally, physically weak  
Boys blowin' up my phone  
They just ain't you, oh, baby 
I'm meant to be on my own  
But just before I go  
There's something you should know 
And boy, I
I fantasize about it all the time

​get well soon Lyrics
You can feel it, feel it
They say my system is overloaded
I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Mm-mm
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body 
Ain't no time to deny it , that is why we talking about it 
Yeah, we talking about it 
To deal with it, don't try to get by it 
Ain't no time to deny it 
So we had to sit down and just write it
 
Want you to get better 
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mm-mm?
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this? 
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is

Ain't no time to deny it 
So we had to sit down and just write it 
You can work your way to the top
 
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops 
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked" 
Just know there is so much room at the top
 
Well, here's one thing you can trust 
It take you and me to make us 
One of those days you had enough , I'll be there 
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another 
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble 
I'll be right there just to hug you ,
 I'll be there 
Where are you? Are you home? 
Call me right on the phone 
I'll be there , yeah, I'll be there

Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control 
They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so 
I keep giving people blank stares 
I'm so different when you're not there 
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free 
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
You might also like
I go back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
Just when I get on a new wave 
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change
I've tried to fight our energy 
But every time I think I'm free 
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me  back to you? 
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time

Love Me Harder Lyrics
Tell me somethin' I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Somethin' bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder

If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

The Weeknd

​off the table Lyrics
Will I ever love the same way again? (
Way again

Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (
Next life

Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (
Too steady

But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
Will you be thеre? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady?

Ariana Grande

I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (
You can see right through it
)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to 
someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

Moonlight Lyrics
The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look , every touch 
Makes me wanna give you my heart 
I be crushin' on you, baby 
Stay right where you are, 'cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold 
moonlight
 in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips  on my neck 
Makes me wanna give him my body 
I be fallin' for you, baby 
And I just can't stop, 'cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
Baby, I be fallin'
You're my moonlight, moonlight

He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he’s holding me tight
And he calls me "Moonlight" too

​just like magic Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day 
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, 
then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it 
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected 
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light

Santa Tell Me Lyrics
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
You might also like
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
If he will be, if he will be here
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
Oh, woah
Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year 
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

​my hair Lyrics
Said I'ma give you some instructions
That you can't be scared to try
I want you to touch it softly
Like the way you do my mind
It got body and it's smooth to touch
The same way as my skin
But don't you be scared
To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair

Almost Is Never Enough Lyrics
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows, oh
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart 
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough 
[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes & 
Ariana Grande
]
If I could change the world overnight (
Ah

There'd be no such thing as goodbye (
Ah

You'd be standing right where you were (
Ah

And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh (

​obvious Lyrics
I love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and
Nothin' else, nothin' more important
Makes me wanna believe in love 
I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up 
Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? 
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?

Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon

Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again
Others that I've had had to impress me before 
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me

Break Free Lyrics
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore 
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
 
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

On the highway to hell, yeah

I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

No more, baby
Ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before

Best Mistake Lyrics
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?
Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? 
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
[Chorus: Ariana Grande & 
Big Sean
]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (
Uh-uh
), mm, hold on, ayy (
Yeah
)
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tockin', lip lockin'
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets 
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up , I know love can be a beach with no shore 
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four 
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest  couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

My Everything Lyrics
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are
You might also like
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
Ooh, mm-ah, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everything

Touch It Lyrics
How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? 
When you're not really there? 
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in? 
Baby, just come on in 
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? 
Baby, let's just forget 
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

It's the Rascals
I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

But we're still goin' the wrong way

Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic

Just a Little Bit of Your Heart Lyrics
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only

There is somethin' between us

I thought that I was dreamin'
’Til my love came around
Now I just come on over
Show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed
I can't believe that you are here
I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me
Once I have you, I will
Never let you, never let you—

Leave Me Lonely Lyrics
[Intro: Macy Gray & 
Ariana Grande
]
Dangerous love 
You're no good for me, darling 
Yeah, you turn me away 
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger , oh, how you hold me 
I get a chill inside 
And nothing frightens me, baby (
Ayy
), more
Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry, and cry?
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay
You're a dangerous love 
Maybe you're no good for me, darling 
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here 
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Ooh, you're a dangerous love, hey

Santa Tell Me  Lyrics
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don’t make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can’t give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryin' to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blastin' out
But I won't get in the mood
I’m avoiding every mistletoe until I know it’s
True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you’re really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can’t give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night 
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold 
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Oh, I wanna let him unwrap me, like, oh-ooh-oh 
Get on top of him, by that fireplace, oh-ooh-oh 
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year, I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me

If he won't be, if he won't be here
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me

Oh, woah

Santa, tell me  if you're really there

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year

I Don’t Care Lyrics
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore, mm
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me 
Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think
But I love me, yeah-yeah
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore, oh
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
I-I-I, yeah-yeah, yeah, uh
Oh-woah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh-ooh, uh
I-I don't care about it anymore
I-I don't care about it anymore, no

But it's one of the things I like
'Cause I know when you need it, baby

We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love
They say it's wrong
But, that's the way you turn me on

Anytime that I need some danger

Give you a set of keys 'cause you own it
Pull up, pull up on me, ayy

You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin'
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh

​worst behavior Lyrics
I've been on my worst behavior
But baby, I don't need no savior
I'm way outta line
But I kind of like the way I
Feel when I just don't give a fuck
Oh, I forgot to mention
I'll be there in five
We don't really need to talk too much
Show each other what we know
I got other ways to catch you up
Couldn't do it on the phone
So can you keep it secret?
This ain't no game won't play with you 
This time I know I'll stay with you
Just promise you won't say nothin'
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
No phone, no pics, no postin' us
This love just ain't disposable
Just take what's yours, don't run from it
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe

Just stay by my side
We don't really need to talk too much 
Show each other what we know

Couldn't do it on the phone

Jason’s Song  Lyrics
Yeah, you really tried, boy
I was blind to all the lies you told me, oh
All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me, hey
 Acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
 Focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye , goodbye 
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, hey
I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ah-ah, hey
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision
You might also like
 Used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey-ayy, yeah
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye , goodbye 
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye , goodbye 
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, hey
I'm taking it right back, baby
Taking it right back, hey

Daydreamin’ Lyrics
You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension
It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight
So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Fo—For you 
For you 
For you 
For you

It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight
So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'

You on your way, it's a Friday night
Hear the rain outside, yeah

How I Look on You Lyrics
Say you want me anyway, do ya?
You can handle all this fame, can ya?
Like me just the way I are
Just the way I, way I are, yeah, yeah
You would like me anyway, would ya?
You won't let me get away, won't ya?
Like me just the way I are
Say you don't wanna be a star, do you?
We step out on a Friday night
New front page, it's a cute headline
I made you a thing, like, "Who's that guy?"
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy
I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for
Been on the low when it comes to love 
Said, "Do you like how I look or just how I look on you?"
Cover on a magazine in just two weeks
"Boy to Watch", ain't he just, just too sweet?
Now he ain't even got time for me
I only see him on the big screen
Woke up at like five, and boy, you wasn't here
When it's my fault, she even knows that you're there
Was I just a transition?
Boy, remember where ya come from

True Love Lyrics
On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring
To keep 'til we get old, boy
On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said I love you and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me

After six days in your arms

Ain't nothin' shinin' more than you, boy
You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it

Only 1 Lyrics
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, "Is this too good to be true?"
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

As I'm layin' down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one

Just Look Up Lyrics
Mm-mm, hmm
Ah, ah
We knew no bounds
Fell at the speed of sound
Ridin' against all odds, but soon against ourselves
You haunted every memory
With no goodbyes, all bad for me
Your pride put out the fire in our flames
Then just one look is all it takes
I feel your eyes, they're locked on every part of me
And then my dumb heart says
Just look up
There is no place to hide
True love doesn't die
It holds on tight and never lets you go
Just look up
You cannot deny the signs
What you'vе waited for
Don't wait no more
It's right up above you
Just look up

And you can act like everything is alright
But this is probably happening in real time
Celebrate or cry or pray, whatever it takes
To get you through the mess that we made
'Cause tomorrow may never come
Just look up

Look up

7 rings  Lyrics
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things 
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah 
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 
[Chorus: Ariana Grande & 
2 Chainz

My ideas are priceless, I know I'm the nicest
I knew you would like this, I must be psychic
I'm from the streets, baby, I'm nothing like them 
She's sweet in the day, but freaky when night come 
It's mine, invest it ; I spend it on necklace 
I got the cash if I don't get credit 
And I'm well respected so she feel protected
So scratch all the exes , it's next like contestants 
It's blessings, no stressing, I'm flexing
Got one car parked right in the entrance
Got one car parked right at the exit
See, you didn't expect this, you think like a robot
I put bands in yo face like Botox

Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

You’ll Never Know Lyrics
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't be mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place
But if you woulda manned up
Put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I woulda listened
But now, I'm with somebody else
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up
Bet it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but
You will never know 
What we could have been
If you would've shown 
Me way back then
Boy, you coulda 
Boy, you shoulda 
But you didn't, no, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know
You might also like
Know it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, what you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around
But if you woulda manned up
Put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up
Bet it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but

But now you'll never know, you'll never know
It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh
You will never know
What we could have been
If you would've shown 
Me way back then

Winter Things Lyrics
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love, no hats and no gloves
Not even a chance of rain
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey-oh
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown 
Even though it's a hundred degrees, gotta get out 
Ain't no ice or no chills, no snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah
Hey-oh
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

Just imagine that we're laughing
In our cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize
Hey-oh
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

You Don’t Know Me Lyrics
Uh-uh
Here we go
Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
 (
Uh-uh, uh-uh
)
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
You think you know, but you don't have no idea (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
You might also like
The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no (
Uh-uh, uh-uh
)
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no
 (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am (
Uh-uh, uh-uh
)
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming
 (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea (
Uh-uh, uh-uh
)
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me (
Uh-uh
)
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
You think you know, but you don't have no idea (
Uh-uh, here we go
)
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
(
Uh-uh, here we go

My love

Baby Loves Lyrics
Baby loves, I'm tryna to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
Think I'd rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's lookin' at it too
And I don't know what to do

It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone
Swear it was just like a year ago
Side of the stage, I was at the show
Right person, wrong life
Thought I could make it all right
See you in the next life
Hope you're close to the light, yeah
Didn't get to say goodbye to you
But I feel like I never needed to
'Cause in my mind, you ain't gone
Still be hittin' your phone
Even though it ain't on
So just in case you don't know
Look at this love we have for you
They say the good ones go too soon
I didn't want it to be you, oh

Look at these lights, they just for you
They say the good ones go too soon
I really wish it weren't you

Better Left Unsaid Lyrics
I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid 
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid 
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said
Oh-woah-woah-oh
I'm gonna say things
Like, "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight I'll say things
Don't play me , just kiss me, babe

Are better left unsaid, said, said

I really can't stay
, but baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
, but baby it's cold outside
This evening has been—
, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
, I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mama will start to worry
, beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor
, listen to the fireplace roar
Really I better scurry
, beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just half a drink more
, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
 No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
, your eyes are like star light
To break this spell
, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say: "No, no, no, sir,"
 mind if I move in a bit closer?
At least I'm going to say I tried
, what's the sense of hurting my pride?

I simply must go

The answer is no
, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been—
, how lovely that you dropped in
So nice and warm
, look out the window and see the storm
My sister will be suspicious
, gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
, gosh, your lips look delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more
, never such a blizzard before
Gotta get home
, but baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
, get on your knees right there
You've really been grand
, I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
, how can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
, think of my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty implied
, if you caught pneumonia and died

Into You  Lyrics
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey-yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey
Oh, baby, look what you started

Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move (
Move

Before I make a move (

So, baby, come light me up and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret 
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you—
Baby, this a microphone checkup
What you gettin' into when you get up?
When I wake up early, I'ma text ya
Heard you got a man, baby, I could do it better
And it really ain't the plan, I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be 
You could pull me in, you could push me 
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky, lookin' up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie 'cause it's more than just pussy 
For the night, everything's alright
When you lay down, I'ma hit the lights 
And what's a life if you don't got me?
Give you what you want, what you need

And I'll tell how I'm feeling too, so you know

Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been a while but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See, I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
'Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flyin' away, away from me
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year, can you
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California
Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away, mm-mm
See, I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

Do she love me, do she love me not? 
I ain't a player, I just— 
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't goin' nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

Cadillac Song Lyrics
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had
And, baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
'Cause sometimes I catch myself
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had
And baby, that won't change
You might also like
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
You, yeah
Ooh
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
'Cause sometimes I catch myself
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had
And, baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
You, yeah
Mm

Oh, baby
Oh, babe

Oh, yeah, yeah

Could tell your words is all for show
Actions display a different role
Know how to keep me on my toes
And I guess I been way too accessible
You keep my presence loyal
Shit, you give off all these different vibes, I couldn't tell
If it's you and me, that's in doubt
But I don't sleep any less
Must be your lucky guess
So you the same as the rest of them, stay unaccessible, yeah
I guess I like learning lessons on the hard way
It take every ounce of effort just to parlay
Boy, it's always in my favor, it go my way, my way

You've been messy, makin' double plans

Every time you do this, understand

But she already know her worth
Everything you don't deserve
We already know the truth
Send the screenshots and the proof
You don't even have to choose

Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah

Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me 
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me
 
When I'm bad to you? 
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me 
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?

Nobody Does It Better Lyrics
So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me
Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

Don't throw your heart out in a letter
Cause I already read your mind
You know you missed out on forever
And settled for a waste of time
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me
Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it
No one, no one

Somewhere Over the Rainbow  Lyrics
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I've heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I?
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

I wanna mix a potion up
Make a special drink for you
Mmm-mmm
Just a little sip
And you're never gonna know what hit you, yeah, when I'm through
Oh, yeah
Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and stay through thick and thin
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little drunk
And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in my trunk
I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
Boy, I really knew you were the one
The moment that I saw your eyes
Mmm-hmm
Strong, and wise, and sweet, and quiet
Yeah, you're just my type
Mmm-hmm

I'ma do nothing
Been having so much fun 
My friends say I'm too cute 
And I'm way too young 
To be crying over you 
What else can I do? 
Nothing left to choose
Except ‎Jason on occasion 
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic 
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic 
I really thought that I'd be like my grandparents 
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic 
Do I really want that life if it feel like being choked?
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic
When my homies link up there's a thousand reasons I can't go
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic

Boy, I know, I know you've been tryna quit
But you love this shit, oh yeah

When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And when I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since, since birth
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded? No
He'll say to me, "I see who you truly are
A girl on whom I can rely"
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I
Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange
No father is not proud of you
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard, you're acclaimed
And this gift or this curse I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand in hand
The Wizard and I
You might also like
One day, he'll say to me
"Elphaba, a girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be alright by you
If I de-greenify you?"
And though of course, that's not important to me
"All right, why not?" I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and I
Yes, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and...
Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy, I know
It sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me
And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'd be so happy, I could melt
And so it will be for the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else 'til I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's favorite team, oh

Welcome to my channel, and today I'm 'bout to teach you somethin' 
I can make it pop, legs up like a can-can 
Wake the neighbors up, make it sound like the band playin' 
Babe Let me get cute 
He's about to come through

He finna act a dog in it so he get the bald kitty

Left him on read, girlfriend need to thank me 
Make his toes point, ballerina, no tutu
Baby, I'm the best, I don't know what the rest do 
Dive in that water like a private island
Thirty-four, thirty-five, we can sixty-nine it 
And I been a bad girl, but this stuff on the good list

Higher Lyrics
Higher... uh-huh
Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me
It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
Crazy, what we're doing: living, letting go 
Riding, having good times and no one has to know
 
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

If I'm honest, I wasn’t devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we’re getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(
Just like me

They long to be close to you

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more, but
My heart belongs to daddy
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
And so I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy
He treats it
So well

Jamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting
Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting
What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?
Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting
Go and hide, run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right

Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all
Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn
But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm still hurting

All those nights together, our special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you're dancing next to me 'cause

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

Met a boy it was love at first sight
Said he'd only see one at a time
Which was nice but that shit was a lie, was a lie
Had a wife and a thing on the side 
Where the fuck did he find all the time 
When he was sleeping at mine 
Where did he find all the time 
Now, what was I supposed to do?
He had it comin'
He had it comin'
He only had himself to blame 
If you would've been there
If you would've seen it
I bet you, you would have done the same
Tell me what you would've done
Hit him with the hit and run
Didn’t wanna hurt no one
So I just slid in his DM, your best friend

Hercules
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(
A zero, zero
)
Now he's a honcho
(
He's a hero
)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that
When he smiled, the girls went wild with (
"oohs" and "aahs"
)
And they slapped his face on every vase, 
on every "vahse"
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now 
nouveau riche
 and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?
Who put the glad in gladiator?
(
Hercules!
)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
(
Hercules!

Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero

A new day, another leaves
And I wonder why, I'm thinking "Is it me?"
Yeah, and you take the best of me 
But you don't believe that I'm not how I seem 
For how long can I, long can I wait?
I carry on, but you can't relate
You holdin' on to all of this pain
But I'm tired of hurting, I need somethin' safe, yeah
I'm standin' here, you push me away 
How much can I give before I break?
I worked too hard on me and my brain 
To not choose the sun and be standin' in the rain
This can't be my fault
But you make me feel I'm smaller when I'm not
Said, this can't be my fault
But you walk around like you're some kinda god
Yeah, yeah

Shoulda saw it coming

Said, but I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
You might also like
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

There you come with your big, brown eyes and I'm so sure you got me mesmerized
So sure I'm just about to fall for you
But you don't even try and catch me, so I
I pick myself up, I pick myself up
Boy, you might be falling but I think I better not
My heart's still mine
I'm gonna take my time, but
Don't leave cause there's something about me and you
You gotta stick around, stick around ,around
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love, baby, real love, love, baby we've found
You gotta stick around
[Verse 2: Graham, 
Ariana

Both

Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me
I've always been the kind to think things out
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about, so I
I make my mind up, I make my mind up
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so
Just wait a minute 'till I got you all figured out

I love you too
Said, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Said, if you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
Said, I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so

But what you can trust is I need your touch
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
I can hide it when I'm all dressed up

Shee
Let's go
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control, yeah
They keep tellin' me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so 
I keep givin' people blank stares, yeah
I'm so different when you're not there
It's like something out of Shakespeare
'Cause I'm really not here, not there
I've tried to fight our energy, baby
But every time I think I'm free
Come on, let's go
You get high and

If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that
Who'd you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya 
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out

Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"

Said, boy, you're such a dream to me, baby, oh
"Excuse me, um" (
I love you
)
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus, you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down 
Is this real, baby? Yeah
"I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"
Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, uh, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell, I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells 
 Is this real, baby?

So you've been telling me to stay strong through the fight 
See, in your arms, I don't believe we're switchin' lanes 
My mind is telling me to stop and you said "Go!" 
Cause I should know better 
And when you're headin' back, you think I'm being  )

I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed
But you're just the same
Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes
Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
And who knows who you’re with when I’m not there
So just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out for space and once I’m there, I'm gonna
Get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere I
Can let down my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Maybe meet someone
And when I get home
You know you better be gone 
Boy you know you better be gone

I have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
That problem isn't mine
Cause I know what to do, boy 
I gotta get over you 
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
And who knows who you’re with when you’re not there 
So just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out for space and once I’m there, I'm gonna
Get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere I
Can let down my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Maybe meet someone
And when I get home
You know you better be gone
Ooh you better be gone 
You know you better be gone 
You know you 
You know you better 
You know you 
You know you better be gone 

Five, six, seven, eight

Okay 
Okay I'm ready, I'm ready
Okay 
Should we sing with her or without?

That's how I know
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
You might also like
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, hard to believe, bae
That the love you have is on-, is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't, baby
Oh, only one
Dublin, let's go
Be your only one
Ooh, only one
Oh, ooh, only one

Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to 
Come on, and if you really need me
 Gotta, gotta
Got to love me, love me, baby 
Let's go 
Love me, love me, love me, baby
Harder, harder, harder
Baby, yeah 
Love me, love me, love me

Said, "Is it okay, that I'm not okay?"
Tonight I'm on my knees, and I have never prayed
I don't know what to say
Maybe I need a day
To get it together
Said, "Is it alright, that I lay in bed at night
Cry a little more than maybe I should cry"
I know what's wrong with me
I need another week
To get it together, mm-mm
Or maybe it takes, forever
A month or year or maybe even never
Don't matter anyway, gimme a couple days
Sittin' at home, don't wanna be alone
'Cause yesterday I slipped into the danger zone
Some things you can't explain
Givе me a couple days
To get it togеther

Who are you to say that if I smile I don't feel safe?
Who are you to say at all? You don't know what we had
Who are you? Who are you? 
Who are you? Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm scared of the sun, I ain't the only one
Who dances in the rain, and does it just for fun
Happy that I'm still young
Need a millennium to get it together
Or maybe it takes, forever
A month or year or maybe even never
This was my greatest fear
Give me a couple years
Who are you to say that if I smile I don't feel safe?
Who are you to say at all? You don't know what we had
Who are you? Who are you?

Don't laugh at me, I told my friends too

Here's the thing
You're in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head
That you are trying to but cannot fix
Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself
I love you, this has gone on way too long
Enough is enough
I'm two blocks away, I'm coming over
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seein' what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Fallin', fallin', but I never thought you'd leave me
Fallin', fallin', needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head

Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't buddin'
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you 
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you
Thought you were somebody else, you 
Thought you were somebody else, you

Okay, yuh
You ready?
Where my "make up" stans at?
Right there, right here
Let me see y'all, let's go
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin' my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Energy and attitude don't really coincide
Stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops 
You might also like
Said I love it when we make 
So promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That's the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Love it when we 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Let me stay in my bag 'cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look 
 Dream of mine
 Say that I'm right, baby
'Cause I love it when we 
Yeah, you love it when we make up
Go 'head, ruin my makeup
Said I love it when we
Go ahead, ruin my makeup, let's go

‎outgrown Lyrics
This ain't no competition
At least, that's not how I see it
You know this ain't how it's 'posed to feel
And not after what is it, nineteen years?
Well, I hope you smile
Whenever you see me
I might be lovin' you from afar
And when you cry, and when you feel lonely
I hope your tears dry before they fall, oh
I'll be on your side 
Watching you shine
The sun will rise
I know that shit's your favorite
And after the rain 
I'll be okay
I know that you'll still love me
Even though we outgrew it
I think about the moments that we had whеn we didn't fight
And the times you'd nеver listen to a fucking thing I'd say
And remember all the secrets that you told me only?
Well, I'ma keep 'em here with me
No matter what, I'ma keep 'em safe with me
And, don't let anyone take advantage of your kindness
Or that precious heart
And don't forget that you bad as fuck
And you deserve the fucking best 
Promise whatever you're looking for, I know you're gonna find
Just use your wings girl, and fly 
You might also like
I'll be on your side 
Watching you shine
The sun will rise
I know that shit's your favorite
And after the rain 
I'll be okay
I know that you'll still love me
Even though we outgrew it
Oh yeah, ah

So, nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
So where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
So deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move
So somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
So where were you when I needed you the most?
Why in the hell would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
So now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess

Ari, BIA, oye
I'm out with Ari in Boca Raton
I like my men like my trees, keep me blown
I give you more, you won't leave me alone
But there's things that I need, like my space and my phone
Otra vez, can you feel me?
Can you keep it real? One trilly
See me, do me dirt, real filthy
I'll be on the run 'til we both found guilty
Behind closed doors
I’ma let you see the real me, ya feel me?
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much

But she, won't understand my love for you is past lifelong
Love infinite and it is pure 
Only windows and open doors 
No ceilings, there shouldn't be floors 
If it's what you're getting, that's what I'm for 
More, I'll give you more, more 
I'll give you more
I'll give you more

I hate to be on your coattails
This the good stuff you know well
You call me when you're by yourself
Listening to my voicemails
All the hurting you go through
 cause I know you
Your life could change but it's on you
So what do you say? What you gon' do?
Love infinite and it is pure 
Only windows and open doors

I like my money, es mi aroma
Shopping sprees at Neiman's with mi mosa
I'm here to give you much as you can handle
Love is like a game, I'm the one you can gamble
Bet on, bad gals don't get lead on
Girls like these make you dive in, head on, come on
More, I'll give you more, more
More, I'll give you more, more 
I'll give you more

Ooh baby, nothing's too much

Even though I'm wifey, you can hit it like a side chick
Don't need no side—, no
Got the neighbors yellin' "Earthquake!"

Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight

But who's counting the time when we got it for life?

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
Io coi jeans sempre uguali, tu giacca Armani
Le firme sui muri, tu capi firmati
Gio-gio-giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Tu i viaggi, i regali, le fedi nuziali
Noi al massimo a scambiarci le fedine penali
Gio-gio-giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Gio-gio-giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Mai stato un tipo da spiaggia o da bagnasciuga
Meglio l'uomo con l'ucc−  che con la tartaruga

But it was all in my head
Yeah
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
[Pre-Chorus: Brittany Coney & 
Ariana Grande

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
So maybe that's the issue
 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah

Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I...

Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it

But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell

Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself

If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?

Oh yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, mmm oh yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away, oh
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yores
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more, ooh
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

The Way  Lyrics
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it
Okay
I'm thinkin' 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singin' in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like 
Do she love me, do she love me not? 
I ain't a player, I just— 
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't goin' nowhere 'cause you're a keeper
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & 
Mac Miller

So don't you worry
Baby, you got me (

Pearly whites and a button nose
And I knows, everyone’s gonna love me now

It's better than fixing the roofing instead
The crowd will be packed, and they’ll probably sing along
Oh what a girl! What a nice face! This is my song
I'm the biggest bang with the mostest to sing
If you're the hand I'm the diamond ring
By the way, I’m here for the song and the dance
So give me one, just one
I've already won
All I I need just one chance

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne

The moment I'm ready
I'll just know it
I'm gonna know it
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby, not today
But love, come on if you rage in love
I want it
A little more time
And I'll take you there
You make it hard, boy to resist
A little more space

Too close

Makes me wonder why I'm waiting

And I'll take you there
Only time can tell me if this is real
Or if we're rushing how we feel
Is it my imagination?
Is it a perfect situation?
No
I didn't wanna fall in love
But you made me go and do it
And now you gotta prove it
A little more time and I'll take you there
Oh no, baby not this way
Oh no, but I'm not afraid of love

But, have you ever gone out with someone that had no teeth at all?

Hold out for a couple days
It's so hard to stay away

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard babe to sleep at night
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms and holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright

It’s human to want the things I want
It’s human to ache for what I miss
My heart isn't made of steel or stone
I can't help it, I'm human
It’s human to want the things that I want
It’s human to ache for what I miss
My heart isn't made of steel or stone
I can't help it, I'm human
I have screamed, and I have begged
And I’ve took all that I could take
I have stood before you bleeding
Trying to find something to say, oh
I needed something back
I couldn't live like that
And to die for something more is human
It’s human to bleed, when you get cut
It’s human to stop, when there's no love
And sometimes it's alright, to just give up
It's just how love's human

Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now
How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head
I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

You seem to have things strangely confused in your mind
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my hеad
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I inventеd you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm

You  got it, you got it, babe
You  got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
Okay,  this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy,  you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh

You should know I’m never gonna change

Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill
So, don’t get mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced
Know your place
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (
yup, yup
)
Boy, you shoulda (
yup, yup

'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you better tell me, tell me
You’ll never know
Boy, you coulda let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

Late at night, can't recall how the days go by
Still seem so light when I close my eyes
No place to be and no track of time
And it's crazy, right?
You got me seeking how good this can be
I wanna feel it eternally
And no one and nothing can get me this right
My heart is beating for me and you tonight
Who would've believe this? You and I
And I never want another lover
And I , I've never been one to decide
But, baby, I'd choose you every time
And I never want another love, another love

Evan:
If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you’re counting on me to come through
You should know that I’ll give you the best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do
If you’re walking beside me
And you wanna be friends
You should know I’m depending on you
So you gotta hang in there till the whole story ends
Cause we all have a little more homework to do
Cause I’ve been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn’t chime
But I’m not ready to put down my pencil just set
There are too many answers that I didn’t get
I need a little less pressure and a little more time
I’m trying to follow
I’m trying to lead
I’m trying to find what is true

Then you have to concede

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Now I'm 'bout to get married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next

'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 
She taught me love
She taught me patience
How she handles pain
That shit's amazing
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see

Only wanna do this once, real bad

Least this song is a smash 
I've got so much love 
Got so much patience

So the news is out about Sam & Cat.
 I felt it wasn’t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, 
for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career,
 and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank 
Dan Schneider
 for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are…. I think that’s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good
I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. 
I know she seems like a simple, daft character 
 but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book…… she wouldn’t judge anybody by their appearance…. she believed the best in people…. she wasn’t afraid of anything or anybody…. she never let people’s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, 
dying her hair however she wanted
… she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real 
One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder.
 As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that’s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of 
Frankie
 in that way
So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some ‘dumb’ kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us
Hopefully we’ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married.
 If I had any say in the story from here on out I’d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They’d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)
Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn’t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can’t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted
Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started… you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. 
We’ve been through so much and you are still here… and we’ve got a long way to go. :)
 Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever

I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should’ve fought it
At least I’m being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should’ve done you better
'Cause you don’t want a liar

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win

Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth

And darling, you’ll be packed up and be gone

This could be us
Said oooh
Why you playing when this could be us?

Good news!
She's dead!
The Witch of the West is dead!
The wickedest witch there ever was
The enemy of all of us here in Oz is dead!
Good news!
Good news!
Look! It’s Glinda!
Fellow Ozians...
Let us be glad
Let us be grateful
Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue
The wicked workings of you-know-who
Isn't it nice to know?
That good will conquer evil?
The truth we all believe'll by and by
Outlivе a lie
For you and —
No one mourns the Wickеd!
You might also like
No one cries: "They won’t return!"
No one lays a lily on their grave
The good man scorns the Wicked!
Through their lives, our children learn
What we miss
When we misbehave
And goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone
It just shows, when you're wicked
You're left only on your own
Yes, goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked cry alone
Nothing grows for the wicked
They reap only what they've sown
Are people born Wicked? Or do they have Wickedness thrust upon them?
After all, she had a father. She had a mother, as so many do...
How I hate to go and leave you lonely
That's alright, it's only just one night
But know that you’re here in my heart when I’m out of your sight
And like every family, they had their secrets
Have another drink, my dark eyed beauty
I've got one more night left here in town
So have another drink of green elixir
And we’ll have ourselves a little mixer
Have another little swallow, little lady
And follow me down
And of course, from the moment she was born, she was, well, different...
It's coming!
Now?
The baby's coming!
And how!
I see a nose
I see a curl
It's a healthy, perfect
Lovely, little —
Sweet Oz!
What is it? What’s wrong?
How can it be?
What does it mean?
It's atrocious!
It's obscene!
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage
The baby is unnaturally...
...green!
Take it away... take it away!
So you see, it couldn't have been easy!
No one mourns the Wicked!
Now at last, she's dead and gone!
Now at last, there's joy throughout the land
And Goodness knows
We know what Goodness is
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone
She died alone...
Woe to those 
Who spurn what Goodnesses
They are shown
No one mourns the Wicked
Good news!
No one mourns the Wicked!
Good news!
No one mourns the Wicked!
Wicked!

I can do anything
The power's all in me
Nobody has control
Of my own destiny
I can have the world
In the palm of my own hand
There are no boundaries
Just simple things I understand
'Cause I am only here passing through
Underneath the sky, midnight blue
I could've been a butterfly
A grain of sand
A flower on the wall
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around you
For we are just the children of children
Of every creature great and small
Now we're looking for happiness
I thought that I could find
But lovе is the only thing
That ever got mе by
And it lights my way
And I discover who I am
What matters most to me
Is that I give back all I can

'Cause I am only here passing through

A tree that's standing tall
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around you
For we are just the children of children
Of every creature great and small
This precious moment in time
I can't really say that it's mine
I'm just a visitor
Walking through this grand design
Look up at the heavens above
Surely they were made out of love
I believe in something like a miracle
The sun comes up at all
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around you
And reach out to the children of children
Of every creature great and small
I am only here passing through
Underneath the sky, midnight blue
I could've been a hummingbird, a mountain stream
Or anything at all
There is only one Mother Earth
Take a look around her
For we are just the children of children

Slow down, you crazy child
You're  so ambitious for a juvenile
But  then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd  better cool it off before you burn it out
You've  got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day
But  you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you get old
You're gonna kick off before you even
Get halfway through
When  will you realize, Vienna waits for you
Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. You're right
You might also like
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you

Rain on me
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time

Baby, I was there for you
I cared for you
I showed you the real me
And you left me there alone with no one to hold
Drowning in my tears
Swallowed by sadness and despair
I gave you my love and affection
And you stomped on my heart and broke it
Baby, if you only knew how much I loved you
I fuck up, I cry, I get angry, I am slowly dying inside
But you see the tears I cry
And the tear stains left upon my make-up
I just want my love to be enough for you
To show me that you're human
We can't ignore the fact that we love too much
But all we ask is for you to take off your mask
And show your true colors
Don't hide who you are, we want the real you
The one who crys, the one who isn't afraid to show their depth
I fucked up and lost you
But I was scared to show you my depth
Living in fear that you'd hate me for my past
The weight on my back is too much to handle
So I'm peeling back a layer and letting you in my head
I need you to know the real me but I need you to promise you won't leave once you see my reality
It pains me to hear you cry over me, I am gon' take a risk
And let you see my skeletons in the closet
I want you to remember that the shit I've done
And how I fucked up will never change my love for you
I hope it never changes your vision of me

Starting with the impossible
Being human there is lots to know
We're not so far from animals
’Morrows fall just like Jeronimo
Being strong enough to save yourself
Is being strong to save somebody else
Your responsibility is not to bail
Forget that you're the son of Jor-El
The real story is hard enough to tell
It's hard enough for glaciers not to melt
Prepare yourself for what you never felt
Flying high above
For something higher than us
Doing it just because
Knowing it is tough
You’re the man of steel
With hands that hеal
No plans to kneel or bow down
You just fly high, sky high
Sky high
You might also like
On your chest is your badge of honor
You place your doubts on your shouldеrs and let them roll
Even when hurt or harm was upon you
Your strong hands held onto hope and never let it go
How do you take on others burdens
The curtains close on my young ego
What do you do this for?
We'll never know
Flying high above
For something higher than us
Doing it just because
It'll never be enough
With hands that could heal
Hands that could kill
The man of steel, the man of steel, the man of steel
Stee-, stee-, stee-, stee-, stee-, stee-, stee-
Work, work, work
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh 
Work, work, work
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh 
Work, work, work
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh 
The lion of the den
The man of many men
Someone somewhere needs you right now
You're always looking up, never down, down
See the greatness in a some hell
Woah-oh, woah-oh

Snippet Lyrics:
Feels, yeah I got these feels

Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once?
Instead of flying off the handle!
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy, too
I hope you're proud how you
Would grovel in submission, to feed your own ambition
So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now
Elphie, listen to me, just say you're sorry!
You can still be with the wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted
You might also like
I know...
But I don't want it
No, I can't want it anymore
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules
Of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap!
It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But 'til I try, I'll never know!
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love, I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost!
I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do, together!
Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever been
Glinda, dreams the way we planned 'em
If we work in tandem
There's no fight we cannot win
Just you and I, defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity
They'll never bring us down!
Well, are you coming?
I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this
You, too. 
I hope it brings you bliss
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy, my friend
So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky!
As someone told me lately
"Everyone deserves the chance to fly!"
And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who ground me
Take a message back from me
Tell them how I am defying gravity!
I'm flying high, defying gravity!
And soon, I'll match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down!
I hope you're happy
Look at her! She's wicked! Get her!
Bring me down!
No one mourns the wicked!
So we've got to bring her...
Oh!

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful
You might also like
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything

Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One last time

I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll a dice, hey
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move
So, baby, come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body"
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body"
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God

Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and
I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

I'm thinkin' I love thе thought of you more than I love your presence (

And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'

Keep moving like, "What's next?"

To feel the way I do
I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever
I believe in miracles
And love is the miracle
And yes, baby you're my dream come true

Oh, baby because i believe, i do believe, in you and me
See, I was lost, now I'm free
Because I believe in you and me

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your **** bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do (
huh
)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me
)
Rolling in the deep
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me
)
And you played it to the beat
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
)
You might also like
Baby, I have no story to be told (
huh
)
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn (
yeah
)
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (
ah
)
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me
)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me
)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

I can't help feeling (
feeling...
)
We could have had it all
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me

Rolling in the deep
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me
)
And you played it to the beat
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
(
You're gonna wish you never had met me
)
We could have had it all
(
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
)
We could have had it all

You're gonna wish you never had met me

It all, it all, it all
We could have had it all

You're gonna wish you never had met me

Rolling in the deep

Goodbye, goodbye love
I'm leaving now
Goodbye, goodbye love
The time has come
To say goodbye
And bid farewell
And kiss for the last time
Your lips
Please don't cry
For I will cry too
Because saying goodbye is very sad
For those who love someone
I say
That I no longer live without you
Tomorrow so far away
What am I going to do
Goodbye, goodbye love
One day when I return here
Goodbye, goodbye love
My love
Don't give yourself to another

Break Free  Lyrics
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
Likе a deadly fever, yеah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah
You might also like
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
No more, baby
Ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

You so fuckin' precious when you smile 
Hit it from the back and drive you wild 
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
This that throw up in your Birkin bag
Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night, that
[Verse 2: Bazzi &

I'm so fucking happy you're alive 
Swear to God, I'm down if you're down, all you gotta say is "Right"

Will I ever love the same way again? 
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear I don't need to be this way
But if I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? 
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? 
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
 Will you be there?
 
Can I still you, you, you, you, you, baby, yeah
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Verse 2: The Weeknd, 
Ariana Grande
 & 
Both
]
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it
 
I can love you harder than I did before 
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

So can you hold me?

I just broke up with my ex
Now I’m out here single, I don’t really know what’s next
But I ain’t even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I’m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don’t normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest

Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl

She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change
My name change from Lil Wayne to Oooh Wayne
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande
Oh Lord, I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard

Baby Loves:
Baby loves, I'm tryin' to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'll rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too

You brought me up to my melting point
And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win
When you wear me out and you spread me thin
Oh, oh
It’s like you’re only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling, you’ll be packed up and be gone
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I evеr did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good еnough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
I know I did it all for love
Started strong without a care
And as time went on you left me bare
Oh, oh, blinded by your faulty truth
It didn’t take me long to see through you
Oh, oh
You might also like
It’s like you’re only here to help yourself

Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
I know I did it all for love
I took off too fast
I jumped overboard
I would have finished last
So I, I’m shoving you down
There’s nothing I need
When you’re around
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right

And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right

I couldn't find you anywhere 
You went away for such a long time

Pretended like you wasn't my type
Wasn't, wasn't my type, no 
But you know what to say, and you hid it away
Like nobody ever before, yeah
Tried to push it away, but you got me to stay
Boy, I've been trippin', and you been knew

Live like there ain't, ain't nothin' bettеr

Lyrics of the original demo
Yeah, ooh, yeah
You take me, you take me somewhere that I've never been
I'm ready, I'm ready to place my heart right in your hand
I'm not afraid to give you everything I am
Take me by the hand and lead the way
I'm weightless, slow-motion when you're close to me
Your kiss puts me at zero gravity
Fearless, I can close my eyes and just drift away
I'm falling, don't need to learn how to fly
You catch me between the ground and the sky
No worries, I'll just hold onto you
'Cause boy you are my parachute
Ooh, yeah
You want me, you want me to know I can rely on you
There's no one, there's no one, that takes me up as high as you
And when they see us floating by
They'll know that love is worth a try

Being "empowered"...... is not the same as being a "bitch"...
HAVING SOMETHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDE....
what I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.
I have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORE. to talk about. I'm currently making the best music I've ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people I've ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.
I come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.
Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled "After Black Power, Women's Liberation".... and 46 years later... we're still not quite there yet!
If a women has a lot of sex .... she's a "slut".
If a man has sex..... HE'S. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.
If a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!
But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women  he's had... he is regaled.
If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!
If a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. "AWW SHIIIT HE SMASHED!!!1!!1!".
I know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.
I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to, having sex with  / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.
I want the people reading this to know that they are MORE THAN enough on their own.
I want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.
I'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that that's just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. I've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.
One more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things I've done / things I'm going through. I don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love y'all with all my heart.... you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.
"any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood." - Gloria Steinem

Do my singin' in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? 
I ain't a player, I just crush a lot 
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all thе time, need it every day
On a scalе of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande &

Baby, you got me

Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya

But, baby, you an adventure so please let me come explore ya

I feel when you're next to me

Problem



Part I: Knew Better
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay
Cause I see right through you‚ boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
If you knew better
Boy‚ you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby‚ if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me‚ baby

Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right 
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me

Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me...
Part II: Forever Boy
Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it
But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure
Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy

I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a fucking battle
Not hard, 
It's not hard, 
It's not hard, 
It's not hard, 
And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was mastered
By love 
It's so hard 
Real hard 
It's that hard 
But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

Not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
And I could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard 
So hard 
Real hard 
It's not hard 
But I'd rather kiss another man who plays the trombone
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance

I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling boy
And how I'm doing shit my way
If I got my piano, then I know I'd be okay, baby
So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

I could sing about how love is a losing battle
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard
