Kiss Me More Lyrics
We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight 
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, oh-oh
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it 
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it 
I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, "What if?" But if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh
You might also like
Can you kiss me more?

Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it 
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga 
I can't even exhale, nigga 
Pussy like holy grail, you know that 
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half, man, lyin' on your ****, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real 
Drama make you feel 
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

Say So Lyrics
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? 
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so 
You might also like
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick 
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this 
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? 
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try 
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

Ain’t Shit Lyrics

Umm, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative

Return your fob get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga 
I'm not gon' key your car, or call your fuckin' mom

4 Morant  Lyrics
The beach is a good place to pick up girls
Because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are— of chicks
And they’re— and they're— and they're— and they’re— and they're
And they're— and they're— and they're
Huh, hmm, hmm
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, eye flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, "Mother never weep," my brother finds blood
I say, "Shut up ’fore she sees," another motherfuckin' trap
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spittin' natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense
You’re testin' the masters"
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models, 
this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (
Someone
 hexed all the bottles
)
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh
Better luck next time

When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion 
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it 
Break some bread up, nigga, that butter my biscuit 
You ain't talk money, then really, that's none of my business 
I don't even need these lenses 
20 on 20 my vision 
Bad yellow bitch with her eye on the prize
But nigga, I ain't no minion 
Millions, thousands, billions 
Bobs on me like Dylan, blondes on me like Hilton
Wendys on me like Williams, shouting, digging
Look at me like I'm alien, bitch, I'm fucking reptilian
Bitch, bitch, aw
All y'all bitches was wrong
Talkin' 'bout I fell off
You ain't even get on
Bitch, bitch, yaw

Wait, I meant to say jealous
All y'all bitches is jealous
Bitch, bitch

Streets Lyrics
I've been goin' through some things 
I struggle with my inner man 
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Blaq Tuxedo
Don Dada on the, Don Dada on the beat
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
You might also like
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through 
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry  and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, 
make me feel lightweight 
Like the birds of a feather,
 baby 
We real life made for each other 
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl

When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on

'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairytales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep

But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me

Boss Bitch Lyrics
Mmm
I ain't tryna 
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna
Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop
You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew 'cause they hope I choke

I wanna touch on you 
You see me in my room 
Wish you were here right now 
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera
We freak on the cam
Love at first sight, just a link to the 'Gram
Pussy all pink with a tan
And I play with it 'til my middle fingers are cramped up
Swipe right 'cause he thick and he handsome
Love a sneak peek, when you free? Can we cam up?
No shot to the screen, put your hands up
Make it pop in your face like a Samsung
And that's my nigga, better yet, that's my hitta
He don't leak nudes, and if you do you could go missin'
Met him on Tinder, he just swipe left on bitches
And he don't even scroll through Insta'
'Less he going through my pictures

Think of my parents going through my shit 
Huh, oh, can't give head, you give me the FaceTime
Nigga, you a creep, I saw you on Dateline
You ain't gettin' pussy, you fucking an AI
Huh, oh, what a time to be alive
Living in the future, blinging on my hotline
I wanna touch on you 
You see me in my room 
Wish you were here right now 
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera
I wanna touch on you 
You see me in my room 
Wish you were here right now 
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera
Is you into that? 
Let's break the internet 
We do it the best 
When we have cybersex

Attention Lyrics
Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite, it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it, hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin', it just needs attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends 
Look at me, look at me, you lookin'?
My taste good, but I just had to redirect my cookin'
I coulda been an opener, I redirect the bookin'
I readed all the comments sayin', "D, I'm really shooketh"
"D, you need to see a therapist, is you lookin'?"
Yes, the one I got, they really are the best
Now I feel like I can see you bitches is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say shit with my chest
Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my nigga, I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do shit
Talk your shit about me, I can easily disprove it, it's stupid
You follow me, but you don't really care about the music

Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it

 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends 
Look at me, look at me, I'm naked
Vulnerability earned me a lot of bacon
I put a thong all in my ass and taught you how to shake it
I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef, but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but 
we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it
, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to "superstar" from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, "She fallin' off, why she get booked?"
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex, bruh, just let me pop shit
"Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot shit"
Huh, I never gave a F, go stir the pot, bitch
I got y'all head all in the dirt just like an ostrich
Of course you bitches comparin' Doja to who the hottest
Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite, it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it, hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin', it just needs attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends
Okay, cute

Candy Lyrics
I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy , she's so sweet 
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby, I got everything and so much more than she's got
And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper

Ah, then we'll roll up a hundred fuckin' blunts

Say So   Lyrics
Yeah, you know it
Mmm, this the remix
Doja, rrr
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Call 'em Nestlé, they crunchy, man
Ride 'em like a cowgirl, I'm a country fan
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
Uh, like a relay race
When I run up in this spot, bitches know they place
Slide on a nigga, I'ma need my skates
Social distance, I'ma need my space 
I done did it, I won with it
I made peace with myself, at one with it
I can't let a goofy nigga come dump in it
I told boy shoot his shot, bust guns in it 
I mean I know that you feelin' me, I can tell that you feelin' me
Acting like you was deadin' me, boy, you really be killin' me
How you diggin' me, iggin' me, boy, you gotta be shittin' me
Is you like a comedian? You gotta be kiddin' me

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick 
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this 
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? 
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try 
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

You coulda said so
Boy, you shoulda said so

Dindu Nuffin Lyrics
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu dindu nothin'?
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to?
How much money could a dindu make?
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to?
How much nothing can a dindu do
If a dindu dindu nothin'?
How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu did all the things that you wish to?
I'm a degenerate
Smoke all your cannabis, you cannot handle it
Wave your appendages
Tweetin' and Instagram, camera flick, bitch, you was edited
Swear you'll remember this, swear you'll be cameraless
Fuck taking pictures, what's wrong with the vibe?
Might as well dead this shit, I feel alive, ugh
I feel like a part of the life
I feel like I'm starting to die
I feel like I popped in the sky
Get in my space, ha
You'll catch a rocket and ride
I spy  with my little eye
A target, you mine, all of this mine
All of the shit that I buy, all of the bitches that cry
See 'em from up on the stage, see 'em from up in this cage
See 'em look down on me, then I look down on they ways
Mirrorin' you
Look at myself, feelin' it too
Drunker than hell, I'm appearing in twos
Drunker than hell, I'm appearing in yous

At my bake, he chef, I cook, fuck sellin'
How much? How much money could a dindu make
If a dindu, did all the things that you wish to?
Shit do, I don't need a band on my wrist
Bitch niggas know about it with a pound to the fist
To the head chief, take it to the head chief
If you're making this bread chief
Take it to the head chief
Take it to the head chief
And I'm up and coming, babe, please say something like

If a dindu, didn't do nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin?"

Been Like This Lyrics
Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
Ever since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
See you've been changin', baby
In good ways and bad ways
Can't say what I say, it's far too late
And I think you made me, baby
Made me too nervous
Cryin' and this hurt and I gotta tell you why
Since you've been like this 
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this 
Ever since you've been like this 
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this 
Who is frontin', babe?
We don't have fun these days
It's more than complicated, I
Couldn't say you wasn't with it
Told me to stop my whinin'
Whеn you gave up, I tried
I gave you all this timе
Gave you my everything
Said I can do this all night, baby
Said I was actin' out of line, maybe
Can't put my trauma to the side
When you told me I was lyin'
Had me feelin' like I died, baby
I seen a grown man cry, baby
Just see you do it, ain't special, no
Wonder when I ain't there
What the fuck you've been sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout how I sexed you up
You might also like
And I know it might mess you up
Hatin' me ain't gon' get you love
Ain't nobody gon' set you up
I ain't even gon' sweat you, love
And we'll never be friends like this
God couldn't forgive like this
Way I really went in like this
Thank God I ain't been like this 
Since you've been like this 
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this 
Ever since you've been like this 
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this 
Since you've been like this
I, bless your heart 
But I, I can't take no more 
I, bless your heart 
But I, I can't take no more 
Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this

Naked Lyrics
Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get nake—?
Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked? Ah
I don't think 'bout anybody
But bein' beside your body, baby 
You can leave open windows
Don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy 
Can I slide outta mine and into yours?
Heels on, waitin' at your door
I don't wanna play no more
Leave everything on the floor
You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want zipped is your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips? 
You might also like
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door
Just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes? 
When can we take off all our clothes?
Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get nake—?
Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked? Ah
Follow me to my dressin' room
Let me know if you ain't 'bout that NSFW
Now it's safe to finish what we started
First impression of you is you really like to party
Swirlin' all up on you 'cause you know I wanna dance
Let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
How you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?
Show me all your tatts, not just the ones that's on your hands
Who's your designer?
Is that birthday suit one of a kind, uh?
Everything about you look like it's on purpose
God was workin', probably took some extra time though
Ayy, all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mmm
Jigsaw, let me see your muscleses, mmm
After we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle
We could take it to the kitchen
I'll be on the island, come and eat, mmm
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door
Just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes? 
When can we take off all our clothes?
Touch, touch my body
Just touch, touch my body
Just touch me
Ayy, touch my body, just
Yeah, touch, touch my body
Just touch, touch my body
Just touch me
Uh, touch my body, yeah
Touch me, baby

Alone Lyrics
Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be 
alone
?
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be 
alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die 
alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high 
alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be 
alone
Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' mе reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in thе ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like, look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, 'least we try
You might also like
Baby, when you fought me at the door 
Kinda hard to force what's natural
 
Maybe you don't want what you need most 
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be 
alone
? 
I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need 
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap 
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it
Baby, when you fought me at the door 
Kinda hard to force what's natural 
Maybe you don't want what you need most 
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be 
alone
?
Now I barely need ya 
Do what you do best and be 
alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die 
alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high 
alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be 
alone
Alone
Now you scared to be 
alone

Love To Dream Lyrics
I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause
We just love to dream
I fell asleep when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost
I don't wanna close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall  after they did it all 
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep  but in reality 
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's gettin' under my skin, baby
I wouldn't wonder why
I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause
You might also like

I look a little like 'Nashe, ayy
You look a little exhausted, ayy 
We should say nah to the party, ayy 
Take me home in the Bugatti, ayy 
Hope you like a little tea, I put it on his teeth
He like my Yerba Mate, ayy
Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah 
Take a minute for the finer things 
I don't even wanna sleep
You doin' some weed, blow it in my China bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Pickin' up his sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the mornin' sex
Show up, hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him 
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades 
Tits on him and I ride away 
How much do you want it?
 Twice a day
Four times
 on the holidays 
King come through, your dreams come true
And trust me, you won't ever fall asleep
I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms 
I got everything, everything but real love 
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out 
Or you could leave me there, 'cause 
We just love to dream

Options Lyrics
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
I know you faded, boy
I feel it wearin' off
When I get Henn' and Coke
I like the way you talk, yeah
I couldn't give a fuck
Givin' him paranoia
He just wanna smash on tour
Fuckin' for that new velour
I like it when you're with me all night
I can't imagine what you might try
Yeah, you so full of surprises
Guess you one of my vices
You want a picket fence and a wife
You never change your mind when I cry
Yeah, I see your flaws and you know it
Droppin' your jaw when the drawers hit the floor

I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
You can count on me
To never count on you
I'm only down for you
Way you put it down, baby, wow, I, I
She wanna fuck a nigga like she love me
She got a lover, but I might get lucky
But you got me on a drain like a drunkie
Lookin' at the junk in your trunk like a junkie
We don't speak, just fuck twice a week
And if she like freaks, we must try a threesome
Do it on the beach, in the sand, let me see somethin'
Seashells on the shore, I'm a beach bum
Finna eat somethin' when you come
Baby, don't you wanna let me know?
Layin' in my bed like a vegetable
Lied when you said, "Never let me go"
Just like a pro, you professional
Stand on your hand 'cause you flexible
Now she tryna fuck me in the restroom or the parkin' lot
At the restaurant, anywhere, everywhere, anytime, I
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it

No Police Lyrics

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
Whee-ooh 
 no police
They say I bang, they never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk, walk, but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door, avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak, bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel, rock the lease
How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police
 
All these bars, no police
Pop a xanny , freak 
All these bars, no police
He calls me copper tone, smokin' ultraviolet
We turn off the phone, I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear Mr. Copperfield
When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tatt me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Uhh, that's nasty, but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xannies for me quick

Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitty's hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put ease to your crazy past so
Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you
Now pop this with me

Yeah, said I'm not kissing nobody, boy, I got my lip gloss on
Shut up , why you talkin' when you know that this my song?
This ain't really the night to blow me up, I ditched my phone
Five shots, ready to party, throwin' it back, it's principle
Throwin' it back like fishing pole, throwin' it back like fishing pole
All of your junk like physical
That's just how we do it, not a rhyme or a reason
We signin' broads in the front while you look off in the bleachers
We pullin' up the way we do to keep the audience tweetin'
The farther we goin' up, it's like the harder they rеachin'
If you see my titties, I tell 'em rеcord it and keep it
A couple twins sittin' pretty, no Victoria Secret (
Yeah,
 c'mon)
I beat my face
Movin' fast 'cause the Uber on the way
Takin' pictures, make sure you can't see no lace
That wig secure like the money in a safe
I look like bae
Now I'm on the way
Let you know when I'm 'bout a mile away
When I'm outside, please don't make me wait
The party startin' when we pull up to the gate
Girl, we so late

Met him before your peak 
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me
I got a man, but I want you 
I got a man, but I want you (
Oh
)
And it's just nerves, it's just dick 
Makin' me think 'bout someone new 
You know I got so much to say 
I try to hide it in my face 
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you 
And you're right
You right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you
Yeah, it ain't no fair to you 
I ain't too scared to shoot, ah 
But I got a man at home 
And we like family too 
But I got needs and wants 
Ruins my attitude 
Fucks my self control 
Wanna take care of you, and 
Just for the night, yeah, just for the night
Do I wanna lose all that I have?
You could be a muse and help me catch
But I just need you to come break my back
If you wanna attack, then it's just that, that's just life
I'ma be real, you just my type
I got a man, but he ain't in sight right now, so
I got a man, but I want you 
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick 
Makin' me think 'bout someone new 
You know I got so much to say 
I try to hide it in my face 
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you 
And you're right
You right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you

You so in denial lately, she just got you stressed
She got no finesse, she just get undressed

Put a nigga in his place

We walk in the room and compliment each other smoothly

Let God be the judge and

Now fuck you, ho, you need a cookie 'cause you hatin'

Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction
I got such a pretty body
Feels prettier when I'm a mess
And I just like to call him daddy
'Cause the first one had up and left
And you can relate to broken girls
I've been a day without it, I'm proud of myself
Baby, can you break the curse?
I'm so gone, I believe in magic

Can’t Wait Lyrics
All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you
Can't wait to get next to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Here's another one about you
Baby, I wanna gush about you
I wanna be the stubborn crust of barnacles upon you
If you were to become a middle-American farmer
I'd read up on every vegetable and harvest them around you
Not to be too much, but I am always me around you
But when you lеave, I'm movin' very awkwardly without you
I have nеver met a man who gets it like you do
Precious as you are
You're cursin' out your mirror, you're takin' it too far
You need to see it clearer, I've seen it all before
I wanna be there for you when the going's gettin' hard
When you're feelin' like the lowest thing that no one even wants
I wanna write you poetry and jokes and even songs
I hope this lasts forever or at least 'til we a hundred
Please know how much I want this

Can't wait to get next to you
Yeah, and I wouldn't do this for no man
It's a understatement if I tell you
 
you's important
I'm just tryna bring you drinks and assortments
Hot towels with a mocktail by the ocean
Top down with our ice shinin' like a snowman
Cook you a crab boil that reminds you of New Orleans
Don't give any time of day to these cokeheads
We too busy gettin' experience and explorin'
I wanna take you overseas and stop by in Paris
And watch you taste the cheese
Take you to Buly and get you smellin' sweet
In love with you, 
je suis, I love you, mon chéri
And if you feel the need to dip and take a breather
Just know that I will wait or that I'd never leave
I'm givin' you space, givin' you cover, uh-huh
Givin' you true love in abundance, uh-huh
Givin' and takin' because we're not a fling
Givin' me faith that it's not another
All the things I do
All the plans I move
All the men I shoo
Mm, boy, I can't wait to get next to you
I can't wait to get next to you 
I can't wait to get next to you 
Can't wait to get next to you 
I can't wait, no, I
Boy

Up And Down Lyrics
Yuh
Life can take you higher
Then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo 
Life can take you higher
'Til  you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo
One minute I feel shit 
Next minute I'm the shit 
It get under my skin 
Kinda just like a tick
Some people make me sick 
I'ma just bite my fists 
I'ma just wet my wrist 
Fuck a nigga 'til he limp 
This doesn't need a caption 
I'm a real bitch, you half one 
Hate all you want, lil' bitch, these bands I got
You won't get a fraction
I'm sorry that you're lost boy 
I'ma go down like Jackson 
Hooks on hooks on hooks like ayy 
You wanna just call me captain, son

That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo
Y'all ain't shit but I flush
Why you wanna eat my dust?
Everybody wanna guess my crush
That's somethin' y'all need to discuss
I gave these bitches they flowers, ayy
Now they can suck one thousand eggs
I sip too much Powerade
Now I'm like, "Muh'fucker, bow to me"
I don't give a fuck 'bout a fake fan
Sayin' you mad, you proud of me
While yo' ass is up in arms
Don't forget to go down on me
Bitch, have a seat in a ottoman
Y'all hoes mad you ain't got a man
You missin' out on all the fun 
Muh'fucker, you could die today
Life can take you higher
Then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo 
Life can take you higher
'Til you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo

Go Off Lyrics
Lil' mama, go off, let them gag and choke
With your Louboutins, put your new ice on
Get your bag, don't stop 'cause they won't shut up
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off
'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog
She gon' fuck shit up if your ass get smart
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off 
She mixed the Fendi with the Shein, she don't slide in no DM
She don't let no one win, she see 'em when she see 'em
She fuck me and my friends, she like a big expense
Men are means to an end, so she don't let them in
She never been in love, don't tell her that you are
'Cause she gon' turn her cheek, and she gon' tell you "tuh
"
She like it from the back 'cause she don't ever front
But when she hit the gas, the trunk is in the front
Lil' mama, go off
Lil' mama, go off, let them gag and choke
With your Louboutins, put your new ice on
Get your bag, don't stop 'cause they won't shut up
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off
'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog

Girl, let 'em know now 
And they all call her Mommy, she don't mess with her body
She never need to judge me, she love to do Pilates
But she ain't always happy, but she know where to find me
She snap just like a Pocky, I put that all behind me
'Cause they get so inspired, she show up when she tired
She don't care if you famous, don't play or you get fired
Her taste is all acquired, she sing just like a choir
These bitches all admire, she buildin' her empire
Lil' mama, go off
'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog
She gon' fuck shit up if your ass get smart
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off

I might get ugly, if nobody loves me anymore
I might keep it simple, to find out what you're here for
Just let me know
I know I'm quiet, I don't bother every time
You leave me crying, out to the sky
You can tell me why
Love could be alive, if your love is not a lie, woah
But you can't make me hush
Make me hush
You know I'm all about the rush
No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better, better
I hope that you feel good
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
And I'm there now, I care now, I'm there now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, hush
If you can trust me, you just might be lucky in a thousand ways
Nigga, wassup, wassup? You fucked up
I don't hate, I just tough love, tough love
You think that you know, but you're out of control
I'm the ticking bomb and the detonator froze
And now you're exposed, exposed
Explode, explode, explode, explode

No one's gonna save you from yourself

No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better, better, better 
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
And I'm there now, I'm there now, I'm there now, oh
No, ah, ooh, oh, oh

97 Lyrics
Pull up in the '97 Benz 
Sexy with that fire-truck red
 
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley 
Looks like we don't give a shit 
Looks like we don't give a shit 
Looks like we don't give a shit 
Looks like we don't give a shit 
Looks like we don't give a shit 
Yеah, I ain't got no skeletons in my luxury walk-in
They ain't know I'm innocеnt, baby, look who is talkin'
They ain't even ready-spaghetti, baby, they sauceless
Speedin' through the city, we medicated the horses
You could hit up PETA, the paint on me make me gorgeous
I'ma take the geese-and-chinchilla coat on a walk and
Don't forget the cheetah print, speed up, come here, record it
If that shit ain't bleedin' and screamin', I do not want it 
Pull up in the '97 Benz 
Sexy with that fire-truck red 
Smokin' while I cruise through the Valley

Yeah, said these are clothes, motherfucker, what are those?
You look like a butter face, butter body, butter toes
I put Can't Believe It on my early morning butter toast
Y'all cannot believe I'm not a fiend and that it wasn't coke
You look so uncomfortable
You could have a seat and several hundred mo'
Hop up off my D just like a bunny go
Hop up out the scene and now they want it mo', I don't know
I like when they plead, "I'm beggin' please, now where the fuck is Doj?"
Pull up and they smiley instead 
Like they wasn't tryna fight me in threads 
In a tweet that I'ma probably still stand by 
Keep ya money, funky bitch, 'cause I don't play about 
They gon' buy it, they gon' pirate, they gon' play it, they consume it
If you're scootin', let me know 'cause that's a comment, that's a view
And that's a ratin', that's some hatin', that's engagement I could use
And I could teach y'all how to do this, but I'd much rather be cruisin'
Watch me pull up in that '97 Benz 
Sexy with that fire-truck red 
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley 
Looks like we don't give a shit, said 
Looks like we don't give a shit, hm 
Looks like we don't give a shit, yeah

Skull and Bones Lyrics
It's cold, I mean really cold
But my blood is warm 
What's inside of me but skull and bones?
Ask the Lord
There's a price for yours 
What's inside of me now but my soul?
Yeah, said
The only thing I sold was a record
The only thing I folded under was pressure
Can I say I digress, you the aggressor
Now y'all say y'all impressed, I'm the successor 
I don't need no intervention or one ya lectures
What's so hard to believe? What is the message?
Talented and I'm driven like you ain't nеver seen
And that's why God blessed mе, you should respect him
You need to mind your business, 
Helga Pataki
'Cause I'ma do somethin' devilish if you at me
I might hit Woo for the kudu and get a back piece
You too high off that booboo to unpack me 
When I arrive on the set, there ain't no holy water
But when I grind my set, make sure to throw me waters
I'ma make it through twenty-seven, y'all superstitious
I'ma say jinx on my twenty-eighth when you owe me sodas

There's a price for yours 
What's inside of me now but my soul?
Yeah, yeah
Y'all been pushin' "Satan this" and "Satan that"
My fans is yellin', "Least she rich," you need that pact
Lookin' like I got some things you hate I have
And trust me, baby, God don't play with hate like that
So you gon' be real upset when he pick Cat
To be the one up on them charts all over the map
And you could keep on tellin' yourself it's all in my tats
And you could keep on addin' the numbers and doin' the math
I see y'all preppin' for doomsday
But that ain't San Andreas Fault and this ain't a movie
But I know y'all be livin' life like this is a school play
How red is them rubies?
You chokin', it's too late, I turn 'em to blue face
I run on a full tank, can't nobody move me
Bitches cryin' with full face, that's animal cruelty
And I don't need to say it to 'em, I'ma let the paper talk
Gotta elevate the bar, the world's losin' faith 'cause it's cold
It's cold , I mean really cold 
But my blood is warm 
What's inside of me but skull and bones? 
Ask the Lord 
There's a price for yours 
What's inside of me now but my soul?

Ride Lyrics
Oh, where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? 
This is just telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down
Boy, I'm lookin' at you, don't walk away
Comin' home at like two, then four, then eight
Boy, you lookin' like you don't know my name
Every day you wanna butter me up then you're pushin' me out the way
 
Now you wanna be a bad boy, papa
You ain't a man, you're just a handsome knock-off
I saw you sneakin', tryna plant one on her
Oh, you mad all the sudden 'cause your man got my number?
 
I wish you saw what I saw in you
Never opened that door to you
 and gave it all to you
How the fuck I wasn't on to you?
And it's a round of applause, but I'm warnin' you
, 
boo
Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? 
This is just telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

Can't wait 'til you realize, finally
Big mouth but the steam on tiny
I been seein' everything unwinding
And I bought you all your chains in a fistful
Rollie dead on your wrist, untimely
Baby, need somebody to trust in me
Need somebody to love on me, baby, baby, oh
Low-key I love it when you talk to me
But I don't wanna be your one-night thing
Oh, help me, can we? Oh
Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? 
This is just telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

Casual Lyrics
Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player, I don't think I'ma play with you, uh-uh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

Is it casual?

I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom, I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right, pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines, bein' shy just ain't my style, now
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm trying to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?
Is it casual?

I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me
If you wanna be the one
Don't act sad and wait
And waste my day
I'm not that way
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Spend your life with me
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that

Hit me when you frustrated 
You ain't picky and get ignorant 'round them other ladiеs
I could come fix you, but you broke hatin'
You want Whitney, you want Britnеy, Jennifer, and Halle 
They ain't cold like me
Put them bitches in my old winter coat, that is so last week 
Them other niggas, they been waitin' for it, they gon' hold my seat 
Kryptonite when I'm throwin' ass, 'cause I know your weakness 
I can't forget how it used to be
In your thoughts, livin' good with me
And it feel so right, when I make you scream, "Please"

Bust down with a purple dial, this a flawless AP

'Cause I can see loyalty and ambition and style like me
Arch her back into position, I'ma tryna dig deep 
I gave her some racks towards her business, she don't need a degree 
We flew a genie-nie-nie to the Philippines, our backyard a sea

Little rubber band tuckin' three-hundred thou' 
Throw it on the floor , make three-hundred bounce
Can you make a sixteen come out three-hundred mouths? 
'Cause I might have a check in the mail 
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny , I am comin' for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails
As usual I'm suitable 
Cute from the cooch to my cuticles

Tell me, is you into head?  'Cause maybe we can intersect
'Cause sexually you interest, boy, visually you is a yes

Nunchucks Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
With the nunchucks, rollin' in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf, "What is good?" 
Feelin' dumbstruck, I done been there, done that 
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up, you're pullin' off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good, but you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me, you do it at random
I won't lead you on, but I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up, you don't want to plan up
But you call me wifey, so what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears while bullshit come out of your lips? I hear
Got me searchin' for insight, insight, guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me, riddle me that, Mister Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast, throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that little Italy swag, nigga, riddle, riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash when you enter into me?
Gentle then you ease up, I'm day dreamin', but I'm woke
You might also like
I never daydream
But you're jumpin' from rooftops
And searchin' and huntin', my ninja
Woah, woah, woah
With the nunchucks, rollin' in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf, "What is good?" 
Feelin' dumbstruck, I done been there, done that 
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
 Rollin' in your hood 
Ask a big bad wolf, "What is good?" 
But I wonder why I still feel so alone 
 I wonder why , I wonder why 
 I wonder why 
But I wonder why I still feel so alone 

Tonight Lyrics
I know you're going home to your lady, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
Baby got mystery and I got history
Don't get too into me, you could get in too deep
Head past the settle down, knock 'til you're out of town
I just wan' f*** right now, scared it might get around
I like what I like, you like what you do
You see my eyes, boy, I just can't keep 'em off you
Turnin' me on, I-I just can't see through you
God bless your girl 'cause this feeling, it is voodoo

Body Language Lyrics
I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got it in on freak
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh
No games, 
no way, José
Foreplay, don't fake both ways
Like Olay, and I won't chase to it, OJ
Soul based, and I'm on face like I'm Colgate
Hallways when I go all day, get it 
Now it's the one to throw it back with it
Fittin' all that, he ain't gotta call back
Trippin' this, prison this, nigga I don't get it, I'm addicted
Reading all my feelings, need a one-way ticket
Looking so fly 'cause I mind my business
Self-proposed but you know I'm vicious
Slow your roll, you can't lie to me, baby
I see it all in your eyes and your face
Want these knees to go opposite ways
And I see you fiendin', go off on it, babe
I don't need to speak, I'm not talkin', babe

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?
You're coming on to me
And I can read it all up on your face
Control it, get your way

Come and vibe with me
Boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me
And boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me

A figure of mouth, don't wonder why you twistin' your loud
She twerkin' it out and wonder why they thirstier now
Every night dodgin' broke niggas, curvin' 'em out
Like every pipe got its own feelings lurkin' below
I mean, really? Do you love me? Is it certain, for sure?
I got money, nigga, know you gon' be hurt if I don't
But I got niggas in my city and my bitches is cold, so
Tell me what you had in mind
Watch it closely, we'll unwind
Psychology of the mind
You do your job, I'll do mine
'Cause the body doesn't lie

And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your lеvel
You're so far away
You're pouring your hеart out

We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight 
Like the birds of a feather, baby 
We real life made for each other 
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

Oh, make me over

A walking fire
You can't get rid of me
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now

Hey, so glad you could make it

Wilted and faded somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came hеre with your pound of flesh

Have you ever felt so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless, useless waitress
Model, actress, oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated everything she kissed
And now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
You want a part of me?
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap

Game Lyrics
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
It seems so official
Boy I waited, waited, dodgin' players just to get you
They been sayin' things, just instigators, while I kept you
This shit seem automatic, I have, I ain't into
You don't really want me now
You know there's always someone else
You did it to me like you've played this game
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before

Yah, throw hands in the air
Swear I can't bring that ass anywhere
You don't wanna fling, bring that ass over here
Boy, feelin' like a contest, how you wanna stare
Your attention span prolly long as your hair, too
If you're true, why you gotta dare, boo?
Some win and some gotta lose
You really need love, two L's, no cool
It is not me, nor them, just you
Acting like a fiend and the perp gon' shoot
Act seventeen when you're thirty-two
Pussy too clean and it purty too
So I can't intervene on your escapades
'Cause I ain't really tryna be the next to pay
And be the next to say, "I got an ex today"
I can see it in your eyes when you flex your games and shit 
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before

You did it to me like you've played this game before

Got that nigga like, "This my belt, I could take this off, I could give you hell
Have you screamin' like, 'Oh, my Lord'" , but she don't need help, no, no, she don't
Until she wanna talk back, talk back, talk back , curse words, big hand, loud slap
When I come home, what's good on snap?  50 shades, man, that's your type 
You got me blushin', man, right from the back , ain't no cursin', I swear you an ass 
Freak ass nigga, I swear you attract, y'all need that nigga, I swear you a dad 
See, when I got him achin', he ain't takin', he gon' give this ass a spankin'

Generous Lyrics
Give it right back, daddy, give right back 
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? 
Take that from me when I give that back
Wait, give it right back, daddy, give right back 
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? 
Baby, I know you've seen it in my eyes
I got a lot for you, and deeper than you know
Never thought 'bout how you give so damn much
What I've taken from you, I can give right back, 'cause
I feel like, I feel like you deserve me
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
No need to persuade, promise you're doing enough, so
I'm feeling gеnerous, I'd give, give you whatеver you want
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you—
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
Take that from me when I give that back
Wait, give it right back, daddy, give it right back 
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that?

And I be feelin' like a dog the way I'm pacin', sittin', waitin' for you
Just contemplating all the naughty shit I'm waitin' to do
And I can lay that out on the table for you
I want to fuck just like we came straight from the zoo
And they don't make them like him anymore
Feel bad for these niggas, competition's very strong
I bust the longest mission for some missionary raw
He could make a mess and tell me, "Lick it off the floor" 
I feel like, I feel like you deserve me
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
No need to persuade, promise you're doing enough, so
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want

WAFFLES ARE BETTER THAN PANCAKES Lyrics
Waffles are better 
Waffles are better 
I don't eat breakfast much
But niggas look at me like I'm breakfast, lunch, and
Dinner, motherfucker, makin' bread croissants
And Captain Crunch and
Eggs and lucks and
Wakin' up at seven
Just to get to work, 
I'm eatin' Eggo's like Eleven
I don't even really wanna give the wrong impression
But he all up in my kitchen
And it look like Armageddon
He could tell it's an addiction
So I tell him my obsession
Then I fling open the fridge and ask
That nigga one question 
"Ayy, you like waffles?" 
Waffles are better
Waffles are better 
Waffles are better nigga
Waffles 
Fuck pancakes

Waffle power
Waffle power
I could eat waffles in the shower
Make it in a heart shape or a flower
All you eat is pancakes, you're a coward
I could eat a thousand in one hour
Stack 'em all up and climb the tower
Keep your damn pancakes, waffles ours
Man, fuck pancakes, they make me sick
I mean, it's like I'm eatin' donuts, it's way too thick
Kinda like my lifestyle, man, it's way too rich
I don't know why you like crepes, man, they way too thin
And I just want it crispy
That chicken on it dripping in honey
I know what you're missing
If you ain't with me, then you're tripping, honey
Waffles are better 
Waffles are better 
Fuck pancakes, they taste like shit
They taste like shit, they taste like shit
Fuck pancakes, they taste like shit
They taste like shit, they taste like shit
Waffles are better 
Ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Like ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Waffles are better 
Waffles are better

Maybe I responded to the alcohol weird, aye 
I don’t even know you so it's gotta be the hormones 
Lord knows, thought I fell asleep while watching porno
Wait, uh, something in the memory foam 
Something in the way that I’m sprung 
Didn’t even know ya so hung 
Really woke me up with that tongue

You ain't even been in my sheets
Got her giggling in her sleep

Give It Up Lyrics
You need to find yourself and let it show
You'll forget it when you let it go
I'll never let you leave, daddy
'Cause there's some things you need to see, daddy
So everybody give it up for my baby
'Cause we gon' live it up 'til our days is gone
Give it up for my, baby
Come on, come on
And we might touch the surface, babe
'Cause love is kind to those who grow
Just tell 'em you don't know who I be
Yeah, I got a couple tricks up my sleeve 
So roll 'em up , all them haters are bored of us 
I'm waitin' for ya, I can't afford the love 
Can't you see, you ain't live in a
Fantasy world , yeah
Can't ya keep up? Sippin' margarita
Call me Señorita, dancin' in my Lita's 
Lookin' like Vita, Coco, I'm sweeter
You can't really beat her, follow me and I'll lead ya
Oh-oh, oh-yeah
 Oh, Doja, yeah

Fur coat and I'm sheddin' man, haa, steez
'Cause I see the light, give you what you need tonight
We don't fuck with leave behinds, simple plans, we just lead behind
Don't make me count to six , give you kitten's timeouts and shit 
Keep your weapon and mouth your bitch , run for it, now my mouth is sick 
Tell me "Doja, that hurts, no fair", see my team, we just circle squares
Bad bitches with purple hair, with attitudes that no man could bear
Uh-oh, look at what the Cat dragged in, keep the rats out my cat mansion
Fuck all your opinions, I don't give them atten-ti-on
Lights out at the benihana, sugar fish and that sushi roll 
Cool ya chick, keep ya uzi home , uzi home
Double cup, po' it in, sweat it out and then sew it in
Beamer benzes and polish friends, yoo 
But, mirror, who is the coldest bitch? Mirror, who be the coldest bitch?
Mirror, who is the coldest bitch? Mirror, who be the coldest bitch? And, ugh
Coldest bitch

Who be the coldest bitch? Who be the coldest bitch?

Milk Lyrics
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
No but in all seriousness, I'm the best rapper alive
You could be the back then and I’ll be the now
High as Neverland I'm Peter Pan, we'll keep it down
I got ya wig and ya man and ya nosey
That should be enough to keep a clown on her toseys
Look, Reddit, I gets my credit
I fleek my brows and I lay my edges
Keep my crowd and I pay my dues
Blood red bottoms, you da lady in the shoe
We pop the bottles while you getting all the booze
Every day I brush another nigga like rouge
I’ll take the L that the chicken had to ooze
I ooze when they look at my boobs
Look at my ass
Look at my crew
Look at yourself now
Look at your goons
Look at all the views that I got on one tune now
Tell me who the queen and who making all the rules
Rock to my shit
Flock to my shit
This is my flow, putting a lock on my shit
Fuck all of the games, but I’ma bottle my shit
You never could step, hop walk to my shit
Big joint shit like it make big coin
Give a bitch a red dot, sharper than a pin point
Bring bacon back home like a big oink
Gold digger
Chewing out your pocket, that’s a bit coin

I don't smoke, would you smoke for me, baby?
I could roll for ya, kinda ease my mind
Is it 4:20, baby?
Smell good like it grow from the dirt
And you look like Austin Powers in the 
The Spy Who Shagged
 because you're so horny, baby
Motherfucker, put the jump on it like a snow bunny
In the cold form but, baby boy, you look hot like the Sahara
I can't sweat it, need it in designer in the sauna
When the time's up
If she got a fatty, nigga, let me find her
Make a bitch pop like it Madonna
Why yo' nigga look like Mr. Rogers?
We more flight, take trips to China
Water on my tongue so I lick the diamonds
Wanna lick the diamonds, wanna lick the diamonds

Jeezu, protect my soul
Wash my sin and let me fly
Jeezu, protect my soul
Wash my sin and let me shine
Mama, I have made my lay, no
Papa, they will know you name, oh
Jeezu, protect my soul
Wash my sin and let me fly
Easy my road, navigatin' the pain and the struggle
Tears overflow, in the ghetto ain't nothin' but trouble
Where shall I go? In the fire we burn or we hustle
Findin' my glow, but the light, you won't see what it cost you
I murder many men, but I ain't proud of my sins
We don't even like each other, for real, you know the deal, play pretеnd
With all this money made, I thought it wouldn't be a tragеdy
Now I realize my happiness all depend
I am at these niggas neck, I had enough time to rest and self-reflect
I did enough for my writing in a pen
My soul glow like Haiti, I'm a nightmare, baby, so crazy
They say I should be the one to dream big
Said a prayer for my relationship with my third kid
When he look at me like she can sense all the shit I did
Fresh off the bed, I ain't jumped off rappin'
Came home to the family with the fam like fuck Instagram
Locked up in the box, you in jail, in the jail
Know that feeling people got your ass behind the door, scram
From the project to a sale to a mansion to a cell again
Like, goddamn, could a young nigga live?
I'm fightin' police, sayin' he ain't got my mill
Cold ass sale got a nigga turned pink been through the sink
Shittin' where you eat
 
and where you lay your head at
But it's the only time you sleep
My daddy was a Rolling Stone, but he's still a legend
Wondering if a nigga like me can go to Heaven
I ain't snipe for life though, he ain't never gotta second guess, no hood baby
My daddy said "If we can't beat him, get a weapon"
Prison reform, no prison deform
Why he always gotta leave a dang stain everywhere he go?
Nigga got my name in the kiosk machine
Tryna get me kicked outta the dorm, so they can flirt with the CO
Z told AD to keep me out of trouble
They believed me in me, they knew my lil' badass was gon' blow
I've been on this road thuggin', runnin' for a long time
I've been wantin' to cry, the Bible say it'll clean my soul

Yup, y'all ain't know me back then
I was tapped in corners, I was backed in
They gon' judge me only based upon the fashion
Mama taught me only judge 'em from they actions
Free of guilt, because you never caught me lackin', I know they watchin' me
When you got integrity, there's no room for apologies
Now they actin' kind to me 'cause I ain't in economy
Cats dogmatic 'til they see I got the dog in me
Oh, you mad now? Oh, you hurtin'?
Shawty need a signature, pass the Kirkland
I see she thirstin', see me and they nerd out
I been doin God's work, haters got the word out
Y'all got an agenda, but we'll see how that gon' turn out
Many false prophets leavin' brothers with a firm doubt
Father, please forgive me, for today, they finna learn now
Put me in the dirt, and you gon' see, I make it worthwhile
Mandela Effect 'em now, they'll remember
Back strokin' through my fan letters, I made the web fed up
Turned a Charlotte to some pancetta
You up in arms 'cause I eat better, now be jealous
I'll bring ya true colors front and center
Get you feelin' fight or flight, and wonderin' why you don't need feathers
I'm a legend, trust the process, you won't regret it
Make 'em crack, no arm and hammer, it's sorta like armageddon
Ain't got no Fendi, so you offended
Baba Yaga, I'ma kill all you bitches with one these pencils
More aggression, so unaffected, you need affection
I'ma show you all the truth 'cause you gettin' too used to bendin'
Over, 
Roger that 'cause I'm a soldier
Doja, all them cats, I'm your owner
Own 'em, all them bags, already stole 'em
Call Winona, if you talk to me nice, I might let you hold 'em

Fuck!
Yo
They be like your highness
Why you always buying' that fly shit?
Why you gotta check them tyrants?
And why you shut it down like hydrants?
Four door or five six
See what we get with that mind set
Now what's priceless?
When it's nice lenses on my iris
Need a high check for that white jet to my island
Why she gotta swag like a light bitch?
Why she gotta brag like a tight bitch?
Why she gotta act like a white bitch?
Cause I don't respond to your hype shit?
I think that you niggas might like this
Like, is the world for me?
Do you ever feel like that?
Like life is surreal but you gotta keep it real like that
Sometimes you gotta split real fast
Turn down these niggas that they heels go clack, clack, click, clack
He ain't had an ass, this, bad
Only if you bad then you more like Cat
We just stack we don't fold our cash
Doja you ain't a British bitch
Shit I just like British kids
Do you mind if I twist my hips and dutty wine on your bitches lips?
I'm cuntified and I killed this shit
I'm done let the DJ spin this hit
Yup, yup, yup

C▲NNIB▲L Lyrics
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm
Give me your bundles of rubber
Enough wit' the rambling, get under my covers
Enough for the fam and I bundle my numbers
I crumble my bread
Come up with hundreds
I'm losing my head
Keeping the bread
Even the cheese with the reffer in reach
Keeping it iller then feverish fiends
Keeping it clean, sike
Speak of the evil and me
I'm sorta like demons and queens
I got all these people in me
Sorry my alternate ego is speakin'
People unbreathe when I get mean
Eat my fajita or get out my team
Lick up a swisher and lean
Like evil knievel
I beat the grime reaper
Ignite like a feaver

Put the ice on it, I don't need a puck
She off the goose so you know she won't duck

Baby boy my masseuse so we keepin' in touch 
He sprung, boy I got you
Lovesick, you don't even needa 'achoo'

Swear that my baby is shit, I ain't stalling him

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh

Like you, like you

Yeah, damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a hoe know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry  and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you 
Like you , like you 
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you 
Like you , like you 
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

Can we order some food and eat it till we feel sick?
And probably stay in the crib and regret ordering it
And can I talk about life and how that shit drive me wild and cry all over your sheets?
I’ll buy a new set tomorrow
Can we just start a tribe?

Say So / Like That  Lyrics
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? 
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try 
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my - sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and tittiеs 
It's been a long time sincе you, you 
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip, zip, zip 
All of them bitches hating I have you with me, with me 
You ain't ever seen it in a dress like this 
You ain't ever even been impressed like this, this, this
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? Do tell, my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe

Yeah-yeah, cool story, but your vibe too off, you bore me
And I be like, "True, do you, boo-boo"
Nobody gonna stop ya , talkin’ all that shit, who'd want ya? 
Well your rich friends ain't real partners , so I dip like a nickname salsa 
And your bitch uptight like braids is , need a fix, so I call my barber
Ooh, bitch, peep my posture  and I read like I'm on that roster 
Dish it out but you're gon' need armour , where the fuck is my daughters? 
And my boobies, and my marker ? And my food game, too proper 
‘Cause your bitch can't afford three lobsters, let's get up and get obnoxious
Doin' soo-soos in a whip, new dude, alt crew, new hits, yeah
Doin' soo-soos in a whip, new dude, alt crew, new hits, yeah
You can't change my flaws, too sharp like a samurai sword 
Revolutionary, adore, can't bite what the cat harbored, yuh
I'm feelin' good, feelin' great, feelin' great, feelin' good, how are you?
Feelin' good, feelin' great, feelin' great, feelin' good, how 'bout you?
Feelin' good, feelin' great, feelin' great, feelin' good, how are you?

Had to switch up on the ride, turned the roof to doors 
Make him feel some butterflies when I zoom the Porsche 
Had to cop a couple bags, needed two of course
Hey, okay, okay
Assume position 
You ain't eatin' with us, honey you could do the dishes 
We don't take no new additions, this a euphemism 
Fuck what they been sayin', y'all don't know what you been missin' 
Got the pink all on the pet and lookin' too suspicious 
You a bum, you a bird, Tweety, you a pigeon 
Here's some crumbs, get the broom, get up out my kitchen 
Take a lot to come and see me, you need supervision

Hoes on my bike, I say get the fuck off

Stay real as fuck in reality

Power trippin', brutality
With a bad bitch who's a bad mix
She's like four different nationalities
 
Yuh, fuckin' the world and I might climax
Flyer than your girl, then she might hijack
She won't fight back but she'll bite my swag
Tryna ride like that and your eyesight track in the back
Of the club smokin' Li-Lilac
Bitches at the door when they find I'm back
Know I'm on tour and I'm quite high class
I'm outta sight, need an eyeglass
All up in my hair tryna bite my tracks

Come through, the coat real, down with the chain

Only bad bitches get a smile from the face so why would I change?
Cause I howled at the moon, growled at a goon
On the prowl for your moolah so hide what you make, yes
Five for the bitches and one for the fakes
Two to you niggas like deuces
Nigga, just lose it
If you want that, bet a bitch gon' move it
Either you grip that? Or you gon' flip that?
But I don't hang with a strap like nooses
Kill it then do it again like "Oops, bitch"
I'm not Britney, that don't mean I'm
Not sick sipping this Toxic

SH◉RT H▲IR M▲FI▲ ▲NTHEM  Lyrics
Oh my God, her hair!
I got a bad bitch, wrap her up in plastic
Lookin' like a chocolate Valentine's candy
Lookin' at your frame width, look at what she came with
Fitted with a short cut, but she's still my main bitch
Brain like Cambridge, smokin' on some dank shit
Money speak a language, Benjamin Franklin
Kudos to my ex ho, onto the next ho
She can have my kitty, but she ain't touchin' the checks though
OVO & XO, pink juice sippin'
On a double cup, livin' like a motherfuckin' villain
I'm chillin', I'm chillin', I'm posted and my bitches
Roll it up so perfect and we blowin', now we chokin'
I ain't jokin', check the hashtag, hatchback, fat man
Goin', goin', gone and I ain't comin' back, back
The pigs 'round the corner, nigga, put it in your backpack
I'm bad for they health, now they fuckin' with that Aflac
Short hair mafia, if you with it, stand up
All my bitches with the short cut, put your fuckin' hands up 
P-P-P-Put your fuckin' hands up
Short hair mafia, put your fuckin' hands up
And cut, snip, cut, cut, cut, snip, cut

Niggas in the kitchen with that white, doing bumps
I don't need that in my life I do not like that stuff
So I pick up where I left off, yes, I still go hard
This the payback to them bitches who can't write their own bars
I'mma go far, might be on Mars
Preference is in Pluto, where I sight see all the stars
Out in Highland smoking violet, my, wallet's on a diet
Surfin' cheddy choppin' lettuce in Chebahtah

Aye, have you ever thought about a villa over out in Africa?
Have you ever thought about the way your body hold the traffic up?
They ain't bad enough, yeah, ay

They don't ever understand you
I'm too untrue, yeah, but I'm never ownin' up, nah

My shit, some of your shit
Feel like I'm seasick by the ocean wave
Oh shit, wait
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
How you even get close to me?
Remember, people never notice me, I'm lyin’, ha
Always been in that spotlight 
Probably ‘cause I’m from a dark place 
She don't even make my heart race no more, no
No more, no more, no, no more, no, nah

Golden Lyrics
How the fuck you live so golden?
How you make your mouth and your wrist all frozen?
No handlebars but my hits so Hogan
Pockets make the thou' when I'm feelin’ so bloated
Click-bang-pow, now your speakers all loaded
New JC's, I can't wait to put my toes in
Posin' and all them little niggas start jonesin'
We might have something in common 'cause I admit I'm focused
I've been ridin’ through The Hills like Heidi
Twerkin' on his suit like Miley
He chasin' like Coyote, Wile E
So, I ain't surprised if his bitch tryna bite me, hold up

You won't be there for long, no, no
You're poison, ah-ah-ah 
You won't be there for long , no, no, no
You won't be there for long
Uh, you're my black widow and cobra
I'm in your denim, your venom has got me nauseous

Puff, puff, pass, light, right here, see me in a light year
Pretty, kitty-cat rest, snow white, tight year 
Make you wanna pull up on that tail like a kite steer
This pussy neat, this pussy fancy

In pits in your boss' pocket, clit, gun, cock it

B-B-B-Brain cloud under my bone cave
I'm wondering what could make my troubles just go away

And if I do it tomorrow, I'm prolly goin' insane, like (

Rub me right, here, no, there
Rub me the wrong way and I leave

Candy Salad Lyrics
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh
Yuh, every night, my dreams seem realer than before
Appealin' to the realest niggas' really what I'm for
Achille's heel is on, I'm killin' feelin's in the floors
Through the roof they test the ceilin', screamin', "Keep us off the floor" 
Keep us out your mouth , keep us on the boards
So everytime you speedin' in the freeway then you pause
Take a couple seconds to realize and record
Freedom is just a choice , freedom is just a choice
And uh, yuh, we leanin' with Martinelli's
I feel like Emily, got these demons inside my belly 
I feel my melody, it's nothin' that you could conjure
Is it the marijuana or is it 'cause I'm an author? And
Slayer, the game playa, take fame or the fame takes ya
So if you know the motto, then bottle up all your haters
And follow up on your paper, follow us to the nature
The jungle is all around you, but lions no longer chase ya
It's a drag wit' no tuck
Mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

Life's a drag with no tuck
We grind wit' no chucks, we're gold wit' no luck
We see 'em gettin' high and don't give no fucks
'Cause all my hoes gold, and digits and toes done, aye
Sick of yo' old stuff and niggas is cold cut
They always goin' ham in the venue and roll blunts like
Show 'em they fall off and niggas keep throwin' fuss like
'Cause you tough in the time that it all took, uh
That I realize that inside they all shook
Some say I am spineless, I don't own books
And I am just an author, author to the crooks
I'm farther than I should be, obviously true
All the pussy that I been on should make me ill
Coughin' out the bills and parkin' in the Hills
My mindset's kinda awkward, pro'ly 'cause of pills, um
Can't spell delivery without 'devil'
Sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom to reach my level
Sometimes you gotta get past all of them and test 'em
I wish I could see through all thems preceptions
Winter is a bitch and it's meltin' off my septum
See, me and my niggas don't regret nun', nah-ah
This ain't fo' yo' kids, so, mama, viewer discretion
Ha, I warned ya 
I warned ya, I warned ya
I warned y'all niggas, um

Uh, wetter than Pellegrino
Before he pop that maraschino
He make me call him Tarantino
Oh, oh, oh
Trying to put this all on camera
Showing off your stamina
And stay after hours like a janitor
I got an eighth up in this canister
Smokin' some of that candle stuff
She wear hand me downs
While I handle bucks
No BMX but I handle bars
And these bad boys can't handle cuffs
Uh, uh, uh
Solo cup, hold those up
Girl goes up on the pole
Go nuts, Y’all don't know that much
But you know I'm drunk
And y'all ain't sayin' nothing

Like a Sundial  Lyrics
Please forgive me I will love you
If you mend my broken heart
I will give you if you let me
All the flowers in the park
I am standing like a sundial
Waiting for you til it's dark
Please remember that we're living
This is what we have to start
Please forgive me I was late
Busy fixing broken darts
I will show you if you wait
Shoot one through diamonds and hearts
I am watching like a sheriff
High above you as a lark
Please remind me when I'm dreaming
This is where I have to start
Please forgive me, I will love you
Please forgive me, I will love you
Please forgive me, I will love you
Please forgive me, I will love you

My girls, they came over, told the old Doja, "Sip on this track, Doja
I mean it'll be dank, Doja, tomorrow you'll roll over covered in old soda
Imported from God knows, but you know you gon' wanna
'Nother sip on top of that, don't give me cold shoulder
When the party is all over, you gon' feel like you in a coma
And seventy years older, so take it like a soldier"
Let's put some 'mac' into your Macintosh
Jackin' niggas jackets and catchin' these niggas jackin' 
It's practically impractical
Gladly, I'm way tanner than you and Santana, you know 
My niggas' bandannas, with colorful bandannas
Oh, and they all colder than polar bears
All coke in they noses, also, "Oh, Doja just want more"
But don't fuck wit' them hangovers, you know

You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
And it might do the things to him, I mean the guy who
He's the one who's sweet enough, who'll shoot to make that high note
And it's such a typical thing, runnin' over a billion men, oh, ooh
Runnin' through a difficult place, you don't need no blood on your hands, no
She's just like candy, she's so sweet

Crimson Calico
What?
Uh, okay
Yeah
Uh, okay
Ah-ha-ha
I had a conversation with a constellation 
Told me that my aspirations are the path to greatness 
Shawty bad, her booty badder than the wrath of Satan 
No more classes, yay, but Doja needs emancipation 
Masses achin' 
Wonder why a nigga smashed the faith in 
Exaggerated, now, I never got a chance to say it 
But I've been waitin' all my life to be the voice of you 
Elaboratin' on all the shit that y'all been through 
'Cause I was there, but I know other people had it worse 
Different style, different smile, different way of words 
See, you cannot frame a picture that ain't painted first 
So, point your finger to the sky, don't ever aim at Earth
Like, pow 
To my destination, one round 
New validation goin' wild 
Now I'm in my spaceship, speed of light, but it takes some patience
Like, pow

I've been goin’ through some things 
I struggle with my inner man 
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can’t be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
Baby, we tried to fight it 
We all been there some days 
Thought I needed something else 
And acted like I was okay 
We just had to work it out

I could take you to the parents, then to Paris 
Plan a motherfuckin’ wedding 
You the type I wanna marry  and keep you merry
I'll put the ring, put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight 
Like the birds of a feather, baby 
We real life made for each other 
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you’re a one in a million
There ain't no man–
Like you , like you 
Like you, ooh 
I found it hard to find someone like you 
Like you, like you

Na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-nanana

I am sick of choosing
I am sick of routine 
I am sick of rooting  for some things I don't support
I am not in harmony 
I think I'm gonna lose me 
I think I'm gonna lose my mind 
In unison 
The way we met, we forget we're different in every way
Isn't in unison
Stop this touching, say less
We can sing together
Sing together
Huh-uh-uh huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Huh-uh-uh-huh
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm

Speed through, I just led you
Spent 15 on it and that's fine

Feelin' weak in the knees

Bed smack to the wall tap-tap-tap
Wait, lemme throw it all back-back-back

Noontime, UFO sightings in California have nearly doubled since the pandemic began. And we are getting new video from the navy showing pyramid-shaped objects flying in the sky
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? 
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry
Night vision video reportеdly shows th-th-three pyramid-shaped UFOS flying over a-a-at Russell ovеr the state of California in May of 2021
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's ... scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ... know I ain't ... sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a ... wedding
You the type I wanna marry  and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight 
Like the birds of a feather, baby 
We real life made for each other 
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other women tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million

I like to say, "What if?", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, come get it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
And they wishin' that the ... was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way we move, uh-oh
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

And always just say goodnight
And we cuddle, sure I do love it

Why you so mysterious?
That’s what makes me curious

Tell me like a rockstar, speak patois
Faded white girl with me, i'm burnt up

Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be 
alone
?
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be 
alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die 
alone
It don't make sense to me
But I'll keep my head up high 
alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be 
alone
Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' me reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in the ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like, look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry

Not the man I need 
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap 
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need an answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it
 Baby, when you fought me at the door 
Kinda hard to force what's natural 
Maybe you don't want what you need most

I don't think 'bout anybody
But bein' beside your body, baby 
You can leave open windows
Don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy 
Can I slide out mine and into yours?
Heels on, waitin' at your door
I don't wanna play no more
Leave everything on the floor
You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want zipped is your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip 
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips?
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deservе to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell whеn you locked the door
Just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes? 
When can we take off all our clothes? 
When can we take off all our clothes? 

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don’t you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain’t coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? 
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I’ll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I’d let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn’t even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick 
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this 
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? 
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin’
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try 
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

I need more than maybe you know
Or maybe you don't it’s alright
I need closure, baby
Just close your eyes and come close to mine
Can you kiss me more?
We were so young

I'm working on my new house, I need some smooth stone
Didn't even notice the creeper in the forest
I've got to stay more focused, I blew up, oh no!
It's been a long time since you found diamonds
You ain't comin' out your mine, you ain't really got the time
Tell me what must I do 
'Cause luckily I'm good at craftin'
I want a bookcase 'cause I need enchantments
Time to fight the Ender Dragon
If you grief, then I'll be bannin'
If you want that diamond armor, babe
You better hit the mine
Day to night to morning, Minecraft is never boring
I'm working on my new house, I need some smooth stone
Didn't even notice the creeper in the forest
I've got to stay more focused, I blew up, oh no!

And you got nothing else that you can do, and your shit is all fucked up
Bitch what the fuck you gonna do?
You gonna go to the store, buy another shit, bring that shit home, and fuck up it
Bitch you gonna pee on your keyboard, throw it at the wall whether...
It doesn't matter bitch, that shit gonna break
Because they make it so that it breaks, so that you could spend more money when you buy another one
I don't give a fuck, i'm gonna play this shit until it turns to bubblegum
'Till it turns to motherfucking dust

It don't need your lovin', it just needs attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends 
Look at me, look at me, you lookin'?
My taste good, but I just had to redirect my cookin'
I coulda been an opener, I redirect the bookin'
I readed all the comments sayin', "D, I'm really shooketh"
"D, you need to see a therapist, is you lookin'?"
Yes, the one I got, thеy really are the bеst
Now I feel like I can see you **** is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say **** with my chest
Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my ****, I ain't sad you won't **** me
I'm sad that you really thought your **** was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do ****

Y'all fall into beef, but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to "superstar" from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, "She fallin' off, why she get booked?"
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex, bruh, just let me pop ****
"Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot ****"

Hug you longer than your mom

Call you captain, take the boat 
Don't wanna rock or make it float 
When you crack or take the joke
Guys on top will make you ghost
Eyes roll back and make your toes curl 
See, you just talking with the wrong girl

They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

Yes, the one I got, they really are the best
Now I feel like I can see you bitches is depressed

Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my-
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my nigga, I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do shit

Te iubesc și toată lumea știe
Câtă dragoste îți port eu ție
Și jur nu mă mai gândesc la mine
La cât te iubesc pe tine
Nu vreau banii tăi, nu sunt pe interes
Sărac de ai fi fost eu tot pe tine te aş fi ales
Te iubesc oriunde ai fi
De o mie de ori pe zi
Te doresc mai mult, mai mult
Cu fiecare minut
La inimă m-ai ars
Dar tot n-am să te las
Tu vrei să-mi faci necaz
N-am să te las
Am o mie de motive să-ți dovedesc că te iubesc
Și cu o mie, si cu o mie să-ți dăruiesc dragostea
Cine e inima mea?
Cine e dragostea mea?
Și cine te-a făcut să pleci din viața mea

Uh, yeah
They say I flow to go big
I'm hopin' these kids is kidding 'cause the know that I'm sick

Baudelaire

No soul, probably 'cause I put my soul in this shit
See how I'm holdin' your attention?
'Cause you're holdin' your dick
It's like a boner overdosage when I go to events
So, ladies and gents, I can see how crazy it gets
When you try to turn the tables but the tables is bent
It's kinda hard to be yourself when you need label consent
Fuck a shoulda-coulda-woulda, either do or you don't
Be true to the bone
Zooted from yo' shoe to the dome
Now who in the zone?
Using your medulla to flow, uh
That's one for the homies and two for the bros

Just another checkmark in your book
Just another bullet
Careful how you bullshit
You must have it all misunderstood
Don't know why you do this maybe you-

You're too fast, move too fast, live too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast
You're too fast, way too fast, it's too fast

You wanna go fast 'cause I like it like that
You're too fast, way too fast, it's too fast
Ain't no such thing as too fast
So, I tell 'em, "Go fast, daddy, go fast"
You wanna go fast 'cause I like it like that

Tell me what you wanna do
Giving you time, time, time
We ain't got nothing to lose
We got all night, night, night
Kiss my lips under the moon
Hop in a ride, ride, ride
If you want, I'll fix a mood
Take me tonight, night, night
Take me, just take me, just take
Kiss my lips under the moon

Take me tonight, night, night
Take it like a thief in the night
Like a side piece, we can take it down, down, down

Tears I'mma give thеm to you 
Let me get your jackеt, baby
Get into your fashion, baby

And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dеdicated to you when
You're in thе mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

And you knew that you got it all the night
And i swear I couldn't, couldn't even try

My man and the devil on his shoulder
My man has got another lover
Now why you playing me?
You’re sure making me mad as hell

Lyrics from snippet
 
When he hit my DM, it's always at 10:30 PM
After I posted a trap
Took me a sec to see why he did, then I closed and I laughed
You're way too old and you're way too

Tweakin' on live
I ain't takin no one to prom
'Less that bitch is Nicki Minaj
'Cause that bitch is freaky and wild

Said maybe you can roll with it
Said maybe you can roll with it
Maybe you can roll with someone else 
Said Maybe you can roll with it
Said maybe you can-
Roll
Roll with it
I know that you know, you know bitches
You should bring them hoes, roll with us
Make you wanna roll, roll with it
Make you wanna roll, roll with it-

Yah, yah
I don't want a pretty boy I want a bad one, bad one
Is it 'cause I've never had one? 
I took shots when you told me not to
Popped when you told me not to
Trust when I say I'm not you
Blow all the cash like 'achoo' 
I'm past the ceiling high
I stay feelin' bright
Why do I fall in love when I don't even try?
I be between in lines, you be between my thighs
Bet on it, she ain't lie

Tryna live like me, bitch won't survive
She ain't got the juice, this won't suffice
You know who your queen, it's no surprise
It's no mystery, bitch, fall in line
Yеah, turnin' off the lights, they go, "Ooh-wee, that's tight," uh
Slept thе whole way, that's a bougie ass flight, uh

Pussy got a pearl, ring got a pearl
Slap to the face, make her head swirl
Wrist so wet, give a bitch curve
Turn that boy out in a Gucci store
Get it while it fresh, get a sushi roll
Turn that boy out in a Gucci store

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up
But you call me wifey
So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips? I hear
Got me searching for insight insight
Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me, riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast
Throw that cheesе and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle, riddle mе that
Why my mental instantly crash when you enter into me?
Gentle then ya ease up
I'm day dreaming
But now, whoa, I never daydream
But you're jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite, it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it, hold it like it's precious

 Hungry, it fiends attention

Look at me, look at me, you lookin'?

I could've been an opener, I redirect the bookin'
I readed all the comments sayin', "D, I'm really shooketh"
"D, you need to see a therapist, is you lookin'?"
Yes, the one I got, they rеally are the best
Now I feel likе I can see you bitches is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say shit with my chest
Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my-
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my nigga, I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do shit

Vulnerability earned me a lot of bacon
I put a thong all in my ass and taught you how to shake it
I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef, but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to "superstar" from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, "She fallin' off, why she get booked?"
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex, bruh, just let me pop shit
"Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot shit"
Huh, I never gave a F, go stir the pot, bitch

When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set

On the prowl for your moolah so hide what you make, yes
Five for the bitches and one for the fakes
Two to you niggas like deuces
Nigga, just lose it
If you want that, bet a bitch gon' move it
Either you grip that? Or you gon' flip that?
But I don't hang with a strap like nooses
Kill it then do it again like "Oops, bitch"
I'm not Britney, that don't mean I'm
Not sick sipping this Toxic

Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too
Light blue
I’ll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, hurry down the chimney tonight
Think about the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you’ll check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht
And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year

Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, oh oh
Wait a minute
I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Uh, bitch, I might be better
Turn up the music, turn down the lights
I got a feelin' I'm gon' be alright
Okay , alright
It's about damn time 
In a minute I'ma need a sentimental
Man or woman to pump me up
Feeling fussy, walkin' in my Balenci-ussy's
Tryna bring out the fabulous
Woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station

Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way 
I said, "Do that, do that, baby, all night long"
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the Wеst
Rockstar, Black Beatle type, bands on his brеad
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do

Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla 
Ayo , I used to lay low 
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my J.O. 
Until I realized you a epic fail, yo
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae, yo 
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place 
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face 
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch that you ever really met 
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet 
Ayo! Tell 'em to back off, he wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and Doja, we let them racks talk
Don't run up on us, 'cause they lettin' the Makks off 
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave

By the way you lookin' tonight 
Only one thing comes to my mind
When the lights come on at two
I'll still be movin' with you
You ain't lookin' at nobody
Just my body
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave 
Do it like that and I'll repay it 
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid

I’ve been on the balcony
Wondering why
Why do I exist again
What’s the purpose of life
So I’ve been staring 
So I’ve been staring 
Memories have hit me back
From good to bad and sad
Most of them are always fake 
Every show has got me sad
From death to heartbreak to feeling mad
Why do they make me cry 
I can’t bother to fuck someone 
Because 
I’ve been on the balcony 
Wondering why 
Why do I exist again
What’s the purpose of life 
So I’ve been staring 
Ooh so I’ve been staring

So you have no lover
Let’s make that one 
You can kiss my vagina
And it’ll make you have fun 
Got you that deluxe to cheer you up
That love in expensives always so tuff
My ass like a diamond not even ruff
I’ll take you shopping and that cheered you up
Maybe 
Maybe 
Maybe 
Maybe 
We’ve been on the balcony 
Wondering why 
Why do we exist again 
What’s the purpose the life 
So we’ve been staring 
So we’ve been staring 
So we’ve been staring

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right hеre all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at mе 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror

Eu adoro quando minhas roupas cheiram bem
Eu adoro quando meus fãs falam francês
Eu adoro quando eles gostam dos meus surtos
Eu amo isso, como meus peitos estão altos
Eu amo o jeito que meu homem fode
Eu amo os lábios dele
Eu adoro quando meus amigos me ligam
Eu adoro mostrar a eles novos 
Eu adoro quando minha vida é assim
Eu adoro quando minha vida é assim
Quando minha vida é assim
E eu adoro quando minha vida é assim
Eu disse, adoro quando minha vida é assim...
Quando a vida é assim, eu sou grata
Incrível, boas vibrações
Quando a vida estiver assim, seja grato
Uma vida, uma chance, aproveite
Eles adoram quando eu escrevo assim
Eu adoro quando meus dentes parecem fortes e minhas contas fluеm
Eu amo que eles não brigam assim
Porquе todo mundo sabe como agir
Porque nós somos próximos assim
Agora todos eles estão se dando bem
Espero que eu possa aliviar o estresse
Posso te chamar?
Eu sei que tenho sido um causa
Eu sei que já estive puta antes
Mas ainda assim, vocês não desistem
Eu entendo que você quer que eu ganhe
Eu entendo o quão difícil foi
Eu entendo a causa e efeito
Agora como cachorro come cachorro
E gato come peixe
Eu entendo a selva em que estamos
Mas deixe-me terminar
Todos nós vamos cometer erros e está tudo bem
Eu amo o seu gosto
Você me oferece muito e faz minha vida parecer simples
Eu sei o que isso acabou me amando
Cara, talvez

Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see 
You can reciprocate

Just protect her and keep her safe

Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, "We ain't got the common sense"
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of XXXX
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as xxxx' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these xxxx dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king 
You've heard a lot, you've never seen 
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top
Divine feminine, I'm feminine 
Woman 
Let me be your woman 
Woman, woman, woman
