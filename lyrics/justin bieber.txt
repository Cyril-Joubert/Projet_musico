Love Yourself Lyrics
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
You might also like
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks 
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
I'm gone 
Now I'm all gone 
Now I'm all gone 
Now I'm all gone , I'm gone

Sorry Lyrics
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
You might also like
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me

I Don’t Care Lyrics
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights

But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

10,000 Hours Lyrics
Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you 
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now, do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

Peaches Lyrics
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah 
And I say, oh 
The way I breathe you in 
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah 
You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

Holy Lyrics
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud 
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds 
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud 
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up 
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust 
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us 
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

Friends Lyrics

Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends?

When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse

Lonely Lyrics
Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

Monster Lyrics
You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath 
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool
, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up 
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down 
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done 
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one

No stoppin' her now

Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets

Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident

Then she started dancing, sexual romancin'
Nasty but she fancy,

Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat 
Stay faded like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate when I rock the boat 
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll 
She say "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing" 
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team,

Ghost Lyrics
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life 
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life 
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy

I’ll Show You Lyrics
My life is a movie
And everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part
And past all the nonsense
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I've got to learn things
Learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing

Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real

Mark My Words Lyrics
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh, I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh, I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

Purpose Lyrics
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept
I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is

No Pressure Lyrics
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain’t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no
I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush , no pressure
Say yeah, say yeah
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
Know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure

Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long, long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone, and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

The Feeling Lyrics
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth

If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

Off My Face Lyrics
One touch and you 
got me stoned
Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise, but the night's still young
No words, but we speak in tongues
If you let me, I might say too much
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober, I'm not thinkin' straight
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late, now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone
Painting stars up on your ceiling

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes 
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone 
Feels to be someone who loses their way
You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close

Forever Lyrics
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never 
What are you willing to do to stay together? 
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? 
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this 
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & 
Post Malone & Justin Bieber

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

White knuckles tryna hold my sanity 
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me 
But you're the one I call for security 
These memories have been toxic 
I tried to wean and get off it 
Through everything, you been my rock

Heartbreaker Lyrics
Girl, you don't know how I feel, 
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call? Take my call
If I dialled you today, oh
Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you pick up your phone
Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh girl, I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And, baby, nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Girl, you see me standin' here 
Standing in the rain, oh baby

I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you 
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm callin' your name
 
And you know I don't wanna lose that
, 
'cause I still believe
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us
, 
you don't see
'Cause what you don't see
 
is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feel it, the way that I feel it
I wanna know if you feel it, the way that I, the way that I
And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart

Life Is Worth Living Lyrics
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again

2 Much Lyrics
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere
Maybe I stare too much, maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair, dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months and that's too much
You might also like
Love the way you love your mom and take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second, I met my biggest blessin'
Prayed for you, look what God has done
Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months and that's too much

Get Me Lyrics
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?

As I Am Lyrics
By myself sometimes, to give my mind some space
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts when I push your love away, I hate myself
I wanna tell you lies so your heart won't break

Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take mе as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhеre"
A thousand miles apart, yeah, you're the one that holds my heart
It's no surprise, and I tell you all the time
And when life gets way too hard, I'll meet you in the stars, you know I will
I'll keep you near , as I wipe away your tears , yes

Habitual Lyrics
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful
My love for you's habitual, yeah 
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
Our love is habitual, yeah

Now let's fast-forward, look up
A whole new perspective for life
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful
My love for you's habitual, yeah 
Not for a moment, but forever

Wandered To LA Lyrics
I wandered to L.A 
Wandered to L.A.​ 
True story
I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor 
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because, the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in the Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us

I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor 
Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far 
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe 
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need 
Still, we gotta focus on the little things 
Never wanna end up how we used to be 
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy 
That you don't wanna be with me 
This misery needs some company 
That's why I need you, come for me 
I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor 
I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more 
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor 
Ooh, ooh, I'm the elephant in the room
Ooh, ooh, my nightmares are startin' to come true

Changes Lyrics
Some days I move like water
Some days I burn like fire
Some days I wanna push further
Some days I wanna do nothin', and
I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes we might disagree
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change
Sometimes I'll go to sleep early
Sometimes I can't close my eyes
Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it
I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

Though I'm goin' through changes 
Don't mean that I'll change, woah

La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum, no

But God always remains the same

Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I can get you what you want

Or just slide up in the closet, never findin' the key
'Cause seven minutes in heaven ain't enough when we're together
Kisses to the forehead, when I slide my hands to second

Stylish sun dresses, legs in jean shorts
Please pick me, love is a team sport

Nothing Like Us Lyrics
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard,
 
it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there's no one, I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
You might also like
But that is the past now,
 
we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together

Been You Lyrics
Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night

All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind

Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new

Loved By You Lyrics
I bought a castle in France and it's the same one I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change, but 
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way 
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change, but 
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way

The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is an every day ting, baby

All Around Me Lyrics
Not sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt

All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah

E.T.A. Lyrics
Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you 
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you 
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, "Where you been?"
Love me like you don't want it to end

What's your E.T.A.?
Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be

Deserve You Lyrics
When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not givin' up
Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight 
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight 
It's in the things that you show me 
I need you, don't let me go, need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight
I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh, yeah
I don't wanna be my past
Oh, when we kiss, I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothin' that I want more than us

It's in the things that you show me 
I need you, don't let me go , need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight
Somewhere in the sky , the way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me, I'm so high, but I'm fallin' 
And now my eyes are locked on you , as you dance around the room 
And finally, I'm right where I belong 
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight 
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight 
It's in the things that you show me 
I need you, don't let me go , need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–
I don't deserve you tonight 
No, I don't, no
Girl, I need you, I can't breathe without you

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, oh

Second Emotion Lyrics
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? 
Do you second that emotion? 
You really got me open 
Do you second that emotion? 
High heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seent ya
Movies all around, but you look like the feature
Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
Where you posted up? I wanna be there
Way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No, it ain't
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it

Somebody Lyrics
Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God
And I'm so damn grateful 'cause you make up for the things I'm not
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you 
In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy letting go
Eight billion people were just lookin' for a hand to hold
Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to 
It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day
Everybody needs somebody 
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defеnd you like an army? 
And never let go? 
Yeah, everybody needs somebody 
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me 
I'll be the shoulder you cry on
Everybody needs some–

But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
I know , that you know , what we got, it don't come easy
It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day

We Are Lyrics
Happy birthday
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
You might also like
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain’t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary 
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
She texts me "How's you love life?"
And "How are you?", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

Baby, I like your style
Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothin' like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feelin' is mutual
Lovin' the way you move on me
Skin's so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know, that
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me, babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh, girl
I need a one dance 
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance 
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go 
Body lockin', put a hold on me 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh, oh, oh

Confirmation Lyrics
Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now 
Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud
Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure
And we got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

Pushed you far away

Get Used to It Lyrics
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay
So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh

Running Over Lyrics
From the beginning, it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something
Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, "Hello," I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence
You might also like
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something
Better that than turnin' into nothing 
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption 
LD, uh
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped 
Post intercourse when you walk by 
More buns than a Shop Rite 
And you wanna sleep over my crib?
Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here 
What are our kids gonna be like? 
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what's up? 
How you so hot and cute? 
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already drivin' me crazy, so just
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something
Better that than turnin' into nothing  
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption  

Love Me Lyrics
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love, oh

Trust Lyrics
Woah oh baby, yeah yeah
Woah, woah
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for

If you wanna be with me

Lifetime Lyrics
Oh, darlin', there's not much that you can say
To stop me from fallin' in like I am
Oh, darlin', even waves can't wash away
Our names in the sand, never could, never can
You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know you're the one
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I lеarned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Somе people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime
Oh, darlin', there's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darlin', I would walk that broken road
Time and time again if it led me to your hello
You might also like
You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah

Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime
Baby, you are a lifetime

All In It Lyrics
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
That's how you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You’re the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Oh don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If I had a guitar missing 5 strings
A guitar with only one string
I could only play one song, ooh
A simple melody
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All in it, all in it
See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition

I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
Because I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect
I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
And girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season and I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you, that you're the one

There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
And you found yourself under it recently, some headlines
To set the record straight, none of it is true
Do you know this woman?
Never met the woman, so
No? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh
Life in the fast lane, as they say
She said she met me on the tour
She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl, she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', ooh, she was wrong
'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn’t give it to her, I'm talking to you

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
You might also like
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can’t fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love

What's gonna make you fall in love? 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all 
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

It’s been 72 hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Extraterrestrials
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting

Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting

Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And our flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taken over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world
Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
After 
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO 
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

Stay in your backpack
In our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother and
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, 
I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright

That’s What Love Is Lyrics
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time
I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes

'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it

I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side, no

Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think

Until you walked away like it was nothing baby
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life was so unpredictable
, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no
Didn't waste any time
But you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah
But I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy
, 
oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away 
like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day, hey girl
I knew I was wrong, but you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day, now I'm like woah

Love You Different Lyrics
I will love you different

When we touch, I think we skip a beat 
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge 
There’s beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss, I'm not used to this
There's nothin’ I won't give
Don't like makin' promises, just remember this
I will love you different
Just the way you arе
And I will love you different

Honest Lyrics
Honest 
You're modest, I like it 
You stay down and you the baddest 
Find you in the cut, I copped it 
Honest 
You kept it real with me from jump 
It's 23 when you get dunked on 
I put it in and that shit sunk 
Off top, you the sun in my morning 
I tried to get away, but it's boring 
You're my safe haven I needed all along 
And you're my dime piece and I can't take less than one 
You the 
You the one 
Trinity, you like three in one 
Ratio, ten to one 
You get spicy 
I like that cajun on you 
On occasion, that's your testimony 
I like that hazel on you 
I look straight in your eyes, holy matrimony 
Honest 
You're modest, I like it 
You stay down and you the baddest 
Find you in the cut, I copped it 
Honest 
You kept it real with me from jump 
It's 23 when you get dunked on 
I put it in and that shit sunk

Spicy, I like it 
FaceTime me the weed, I just might buy it
Throw it back on the couch, I just might try
Ooh, spicy 
Damn, that booty thick, I like it 
Hey, Justin B. 
I know you don't do this often, but this here sneak and geek 
Fuck that McLaren, I'm ridin' the Jeep 
I got in the club with all of my thugs, I'm packin' that 
Pistol Pete
 
Better watch your mouth, gotta pick a side before you jump and leap 
I was sellin' the nickels and dimes in dubs, but crack in my sock, it ain't me 
But, baby, I like it 
I'ma pull that double R to your crib just for once 
It's 23 when you get dunked 
Me and JB, we smokin' skunk

Don Toliver

There's no sophistication in my lack of patience
I'm just wishing you were better at communication
As I sit here steady waiting
Wishing that you would call my name in
[Pre-Chorus: 
 & Justin Bieber]
It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me
(Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)
Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
What should I do? Should I go?
Who do I talk to? Nobody knows
Who knows the answer to all of my questions?
When will I get over this, over this?

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs 
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him
Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, 
Giussepe steppin'
 
with a mink
, 
gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came

Justin Bieber
Damn, damn, JB, where the hell you been?
Yeah, I got a new necklace, diamonds
Two big-face Rollies, no, I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah, you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan: kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all-black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses
I thanked Jesus at the awards, I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect, she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally, I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these 'cause baby, I'm a money tree
So be my little honey, be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me, baby, I just get it done-y
Possibly, you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably, but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies, see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me, I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice, but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no, they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and
 
it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that "It's not mine"
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah, without them, I'd be blurry

Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"
I'd like to give you what you need

Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don
I'd like to give you what you need

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone
And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken

Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light

Angels Speak Lyrics
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
You encourage everyone without tryin'
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?

Flatline, flatline, flatline, flatline
Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different? Talk to me, I'll listen
All the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know
I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there
Girl, you always catch me at the bad time 
When I know you probably think it's a lie 
I know I told you last time was the last time 
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? 
Flatline , flatline 
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? 
'Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply 
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline?
Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?
She said she's leaving, damn, I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what I'ma do now

Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumours spreadin' 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause, baby, I didn't

Red Eye Lyrics
Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down
You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti 
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already 
My bed is depressed 
My pillow's a victim 
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (
B-O-I
)
And I gotta fly out (
Ha
)
Hate you got me strung-out (
Ha

And I gotta fly out (
Hey

Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night

At Least For Now Lyrics
I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah
Right leg crossed while you're smokin' a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody takin' pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines?
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin' you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now

Hailey Lyrics
Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go 
'Cause all I know
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what , no mattеr what 
It's only us 
Yeah, no matter what
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (
Ever wanted

Ayy, baby, I got a question
Baby, I wanna know what you see in me? 
Tell me the truth, keep it a hunnid, keep it G with me 
Ain't no love up in these streets, and life ain't promisin' 
How many times that you got mad, or told me you done with me? 
All these hoes you think I'm talkin' to, mean nothin' to me 
Hop on the jet, come with me, and come live comfortably 
I ain't bringin' my gang, you ain't bringin' your friends, we don't need no company 
If I hit me a lick, and I told you I'm hot, would you go on a run with me? 
Trying to check my phone, look at my messages, see who I'm messagin' 
Make her real mad, but she can't find shit, and thеre ain't no evidencе 
You say you love me, you say you wanna be with me 
I'm askin' questions, and I need you to answer me

There She Go Lyrics

Talk is cheap, so I'ma let all my actions speak, yeah
Centerfold, baby, goin' vogue, crazy
Rock and roll, you're my rollin' stone, baby
Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice 
How you don't go nowhere without going unnoticed 
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's my best friend 
I hear you callin', see you ringing from your left hand 
Locked it down when you wanted, that hopeless romance 
This happened so fast, I love it when we slow dance
You can break it down, you don't need a pole
I'm so proud of you, I bust you down in rose gold
Don't be ashamed, girl, I messed around, you messed up too
It all changed when you took my name and went insane, mmm

Got your legs shakin' like the Go-Go Challenge, so 
Crushed grapes in Mauritius
Girl, you my flavor of love, you so delicious
I'ma make you my missus
All these candy-coated kisses, you my strawberry shortcake
That ass'll make me catch a charge and miss the court date
Sweet as honeydew, watch me kneel right in front of you
We'll set the world on fire, then light a blunt or two 
I got the keys, we can have it on lock
And I'll lick you like ice cream with a cherry on top

Runaway Love  Lyrics
Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
You might also like
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time, 
where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, "Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this 
sixteen years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, "You lookin' good, fly colored Asian"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love
I'm running out of time, 
where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this ****, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on
I'm running out of time, 
where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, 
where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

Take It Out On Me Lyrics
Kid
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me
You might also like
Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that
You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might 
And get it all out 'til you feel light 
And take it out on me 
You can take it out on me 

It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth, that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk, you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be, woah
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
Whoa
I never understood you when you'd say, oh

Big up to my brother
Blessed sons and daughters
We all lookin' for the answers
We in search of living water
Too blind to see the Messiah
Are you weary? Are you tired?
Runnin' on empty, feelin' the fire
Mmm, the devil is a liar
The story's already written
Children, you are forgiven 
Ain't nothin' you could do for you to change that
And everything you did, He erased that
Yeah, He took it all and threw it in the wasteland

Big up to our Father 
If you call 'pon Him, Him answer 
All we need a the begotten son to prosper 
The dead resurrected, the devil tried test it, him lost
Him lose again , head bruise again 
Sweat, blood, tears 'pon the cross, did you know He paid the cost for you?
Work over North, West, South, and East, Easter Sunday, bun and cheese
Good Friday, fish and bammy, one table and one family
All of the times weh mi cry for The Most High

Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?
Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl
In my head, we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love
Madly in love
Babe, you are the reason to breathe
And babe, you know you're all that I need
Remember when you took my hand
And ran away 
And wandered off to Chinatown
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
When I look into your eyes

Name Lyrics
You're making promises to someone else's face
If those should break, 
call out my name
You're getting high off of some new life that you made
If that high fades, call out my name
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line
At your best friend's house
We're only getting better at pretending we're okay
And after all this time, we feel the same
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Cards on the table that we never got to play
Oh, what a shame, call out my name
I bet he's cool, but I put fire in your veins
If you miss that flame, call out my name
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Tori Kelly, 
Tori Kelly
]
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line
At your best friend's house
We're only getting better at pretending we're okay
And after all this time
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch (
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
)
Going line for line (
Going line for line
)
At your best friend's house
We're only getting better at pretending we're okay (
Yeah

Come here
I don't know what happened
Where did they go?
Nights like this don’t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control?
 
Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don’t know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no flights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
There's a reason what this happened for, yeah

Oh oh ohh-oh-oh, oh oh ohh-oh-oh
Oh oh ohh-oh-oh, and I pray
I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home
But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day

I lose my appetite 
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause of my dinner, still there on my plate?

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand that it's meant to be
'Cause baby, when you're with me
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
'Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh, no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go
I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh, no, because

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that it'd be easy

I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day, some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will bе criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somеbody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well, you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justi–

Know No Better Lyrics
When I look at you, yeah, I see forever
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh
I can see us vibin' for the rest of our days 
Jumpin' over hurdles that try to get in our way 
And they can say what they wanna say, baby, we can go all the way
Just take my hand and follow me, yeah
I want you and only you, yes, I do
I wanna kick it like kung fu, wanna see what the drums do 
And you know I could tell no lies and that's on God
'Cause you're the one that I run to, mic chеck, one-two, one-two
No one compеtes, you're all I need
Big flash, say, "Cheese," vacay in Paris
You're my baby boo like a ghost, when the tide rides, we gon' flow
Yeah, they try to stop us like no, like no, oh, no
When I look at you, yeah, I see forever
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

She like, "I didn't know you sing like that," I don't
I'm just givin' out flavor , let's order a charter 
Won't go to the airport, let's fly to Jamaica 
I know that your friends wanna come with you, you can take 'em 
'Cause I'm not a bad sport , you're gon' need a passport
Me and you are a team
I'll be your bestie
Just promise you're gon' love me and protect me

And you curved 'em all to the left, everybody, except me

With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two 
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do 
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two 
Now we don't wanna fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do 
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do 
To fight with time and space 
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

We’re In This Together Lyrics
Yeah, it's not easy growin' up
You know, mm
Only two years old, I was playin' drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young, I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later, hehe
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah
That wasn't easy 'cause at seventeen, I had a milli'
Women throwin' themselves at me had me goin' silly
On the surface, I felt like thе man
But deep inside I felt deprivеd just like an empty can
I've had everything in life that people strive for 
Just to ask the question, "What are we alive for?" 
What you believe? And would you agree? Well, what would you die for? 
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh, we're in this together

I moved out when I was eighteen
I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin'
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin'
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash our sins away
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question, "What are we alive for?"
What you believe? And would you agree? Well, what would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh, we're in this together
I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace, I pray for joy, I pray for confidence, I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters, bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, "Everything is going to be all right."
In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord
Where are you now that I need you?

All She Wrote Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We reject what we don't understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin'
Heart is hard, and can't nobody see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I can't stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous 'cause they wanna be me
Damn it, man, this life ain't easy
It takes over me
My unforgiveness keeps control of mе
Damn it, I gotta get a hold of me
Gotta get a hold of mе, oh
What you want out of life? That's the question
This ain't a simulation, it's a blessin'
Is it a mistake or is it destined?
We ain't got no time for second-guessin'
We can't save ourselves, we need a savior
We ain't make ourselves, we need a maker
I keep failin' myself, I need somethin' new
So I lay my life down, I give it all to You
[Bridge: Chandler Moore & 
Justin Bieber

I came to the end of me, believin' the enemy
Comin' with that "Mmm," man, you ain't a friend of me

Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a master's in forgiveness
I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
I'd rather pray to God than pray for wishes
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm 'bout my Father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish
You can't undermine a mastermind
I may be out of your mind, but I ain't out of mine
I'm co-crucified, bury, resurrected
And perfected in the Son of God
Just like water turn to wine, I'm a prophetic sign
Ask your barber, I'm a headliner in New York Times
My life verses, I am His, yeah, and He is mine
The great "I Am"'s, the greatest Lamb of all time
Rebranded, redesigned and redefined
From Brandon to brand new, I'ma brand name in the household, brand too
Who are you to try to tell me what I can't do? We need a pull, huh?
You ever ask yourself, "Am I gonna make it?"
Well, I don't know, of course I can fake it
But honestly, can I go wrong?
I'm so tired, I'm so broken, I'm so weary
Oh, God, oh, God

When the day is over and those thoughts set in
That's when I start to wonder, where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that You're holdin' me tight
You say the past is behind me and it'll be alright
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & 
Tori Kelly

And You say to me, "It'll be alright"
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
When I'm all alone and fear is all I see
Sittin' in the silence with these insecurities
And then You remind me, You're holdin' me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side

I know You're not a God out there hidin' on mountains, oh, no
You come right where I am, lost my way, but You found me

And then You remind me that You're holdin' me tight

I hear those words over and over, "It'll be alright"
Go to sleep, My child, it'll be alright
Sleep soundly, My child, it'll be alright
I'm right here, My child, it'll be alright
I won't go anywhere, it'll be alright
You're in the palm of My hand, it'll be alright
My arms are wrapped around you, it'll be alright
While you sleep, I watch over you, it'll be alright
I'll take care of your loved ones, it'll be alright
Your future's in My hands, it'll be alright
Your past is forgiven, it'll be alright
Your future is secure, it'll be alright
I forgive you, it'll be alright
I'm your friend that's closer than a brother, it'll be alright
Sleep now for when the morning comes
My mercies will be new, it'll be alright (

Where You go, I follow 
You're with me every step of the way
Here in the struggle 
Your love's enough to wash it all away
On the third day, yeah, You rose up and You beat death once and for all 
Once and for all 
There's nobody like You 
There's nobody like You, Jesus 
There'll nеver be nobody like You 
There'll never be nobody like You, Jesus

At times my mind is feeling hazy
But, Lord, You always come and save me
God Almighty, my safety
You're my end, You're my new beginning
You're my home, the One I confide in
You're the very air I breathe
The reason that I sing
Oh, I've tried it all
Nothing could fix the damage in my heart
'Til I met Your love
Oh, You gave Your life so I won't fall apart

On the third day, yeah, You rose up and You beat death once and for all 
Oh-oh, once and for all, yeah, ayy-ayy
[Chorus: Justin Bieber &

There's nobody like You (
Oh-oh-oh-oh
)
There's nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus; 
No-oh-oh
)
There'll never be nobody like You (
Oh-oh-oh
)
There'll never be nobody like You, Jesus  (
Yeah, yeah, ayy-ayy, yeah
)
Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
Hasn't billions of men and women lived on this planet?
But why, why are we convinced there's nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
"Is there anyone like Jesus? Who is this Jesus?"
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so, there is nobody like Jesus 

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around and I'm like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 16, and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone, so far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favourite song, she was wrong, I am gone
I thought I loved her, never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover, but now until another like

She don't like the flash
Wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
Hate it when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for her
Gonna throw us all away cause it's too much for her
She can't hide away, cause the world knows who we are
She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, whoah

How can I choose between the two, when all the lights are all I know?
I wish she could see how good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life without her by my side
Cause she gives the light that's in me
But she don't know whoah, she don't know whoah
She don't like the lights
The lights
The lights, the lights whoah
She don't like the lights whoah

Afraid To Say Lyrics
I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly, I wanna hold back
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we say?
 
I wanna grow, but I'm afraid 
And will it always be the same? 
Does what I gotta say even matter? 
Is life about climbin' up the ladder?
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writin' 'em off is not the answer
Do we got the room to make mistakes? 
Are we judged for everything we say?
 
I wanna grow, but I'm afraid 
And will it always be the same? 
Does what I gotta say even matter? 
Is life about climbin' up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled 
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writin' 'em off is not the answer

He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off

You formed the whole of me (
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
), inward and out (
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
)
I am awesomely and wonderfully created (
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
)
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me (
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
), You saw the essence of me before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book Psalms 139:13-16

It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Well, tell me is it wrong?
Wrong for me to say this?
That our relationship's been rough for a long time
Well baby, do you care?
Care about my heart, babe?
Acting like it don't phase you
Baby girl, I wanna make you
I wanna make you mine
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay

I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel the love in the air?

So when the lights turn off
And this love don't last
There is one question I would ask
Is it cause when we first started, we was movin' really fast
It is 'cause it was blurry and we worried about the past
Well now baby girl, I'm startin' fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, I'ma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl, you're who I cherish
Don't get worried about your parents
We gon' chill
And girl I'll be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room
Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!
Girl, I know you feel this lust
Girl, you always on my side, cause you know that, that's a must, yes us
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

And if you think of me sometimes
'Cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough trying to forget you
But the more that I look around, the more I realize
You're all I'm looking for
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me 
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, yeah
Just friends, the beginning or the end
How do we make sense, when we're on our own?
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, yeah, should have known
Nothing in the world compares to the feelings that we share
So not fair

I was scared, it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me

Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Now we steppin' out like oh God, cameras point and shoot
Ask me, "What's my best side?" I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues, baby, true, true, true, but I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song  I'll have figured out

Gotta have all the new chicks, my bad, I'm sick

Beautiful Love  Lyrics
More than often
We don't take advantage of the beauty all around us 
Oh-oh-oh, more than often
We take each other's time for granted 'cause we're always around us, oh, yeah
Like the blue skies
We don't appreciate the sun until it rains 
Try to see it like a child
Oh, the innocence in everything we do
A beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you arе
What a beautiful, beautiful love, lovе, love, that's who you are
Every day we wake up is a blessin'
Yeah, consider everything we do a new beginnin', a chance to start over
And Lord knows we ain't perfect, that's far from our usual
The journey is more than worth it, I hope this feeling's mutual
What a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you are
What a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you are, yeah

Yeah, JB, yeah, woah, no no
Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me

Intentions  Lyrics
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse 
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention

Over the mountains, across the sky

Let’s go
There’s something different in your eyes baby
You can’t seem to look into mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gon' assume that something’s wrong
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not really tripping, I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them

Look at all the choices, the choices in this world
World spreading no freedom, freedom for the boys and the girls
But the boys and the girls they don’t know, what love is like
Love is like appreciation mixed in a double cup of Sprite
So can we go?
No left or right
You go your way
And I'll go mine
Cause this is my time
And I won’t waste it
Thinking 'bout what you gotta say
Cause I'm here to stay
Look at all the places, places that I've been
It doesn't come easy, you gotta have strength
And when it goes down and it’s all said and done
You gotta stand up so there’s no need to run
And now that I've made it
I won’t look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me, yes I did

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

Never understood why you stayed around
How many pieces that I've break your heart in
Just so I can put it back together
With everything, you've given me your pardon
No, I don't derserve you no, no, no
Don't deserve a love so precious
Can't nobody love like you
Every time I shut the door
You always let me right back through
Tired of myself makin' the same mistakes
Made me re-evaluate the way I live

Double Negative  Lyrics
No sleep at all, runnin' a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
That's a , that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, draggin' along
Won't pick up the phone while I'll be gone
Can't deny it
It's a double negative
Oh, double negative
'Nother jet, 'nother day in the sky
Fly in another direction from you
Wish I could FedEx my heart
And show up to your door
Signed, sealed, delivered
Gonna make you cry, let you down
More than likely from across town
Double shame on me
Double shame, oh
No sleep at all, runnin' a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
That's a , that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, draggin' along
Won't pick up the phone while I'll be gone

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today

With hope in every heart

You called me, tried to shake the other line
In a hurry, know you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love

Su-sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while
First degree burns don't leave scars
We can turn this plane around

You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you, for the strength you’ve instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you, I still turn to you
It was ’94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart

Many Men* Lyrics
Snippet
Took out the lambo
Man, this thing got handles
One hand on the booty, this a damn scandal
Ready for it like you panhandle
Pants saggin', I'm a damn vandal
Like Van Damme do it
Took a couple years off, shed a couple tears, dog, messed up here and there
No fear here, dog, got a wife, living life, living right, yeah, it's tight
Gluten free, look at me, would'a thought I'd be nice
When I rap, I will slap on the beat
I attack with the heat, no strap
I defeat, no cap
Yeah, my style is impeccable, my wife, yeah, I put her on a pedestal
Yeah, my life is like the movie 
The Incredibles
They put me on some medicine
Never thought that my depression would depend on it, I've been sending it
Going hard running on adrenaline
Been a victim of the system, I'm a Christian with a vision, I'm a gentleman
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can see
I'm tryna be what I'm destined to be and people try to take my life away
I don't hold grudges cause I ain't no sucker
Why let it get to me when we don't even know each other, go ahead and talk what you want about me and I'm gonna go and turn the other way
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eyes dog and I can see
I'm tryna be what I'm destined to be and people try to take my life away
I don't hold grudges cause I ain't no sucker
I don't even let it get to me, go ahead and talk what you want about me and I'm gonna go and turn the other way

Lyrics from snippet:
..and open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is 'bout a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love
And don't let go, oh no
And every single time you want a break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath every step
Let it wash away
Wash away, oh wash away
Before the number was the name
March 1st before player was the game
21 years ago, it’s never ever been the same
In all my life I never wanted to play the game
I'm not the same as Michael even though he hall of fame
I'm all hall of faith put me on the wall of change
I got a couple things to learn along the way
Figure out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me

Never say never, yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
[Verse 3: Jaden Smith & 
Justin Bieber
]
Here we go, guess who?
J Smith and JB
, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro
, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, swish
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never

Never say never and never say never 
Never say never, never say never

Running everywhere trying to find who I am
Going nowhere so I'm trying again
I am so lost like paper no pen
Yes you have call so, yes, here I am
Cold no sweater
Bold no letter
So much better
My role go-getter
My tole is red then the fire in my eyes
I'mma rain no weather
The goal I'mma set is a whole lot better
When the storm from Jehovah comes
I'm gonna be the best ever
Love from the start
Peace in my heart
I'mma roll ah were never be apart
But I still wonder
Have I felt the thunder?
I can feel it in my heart shooting like a like a hunter
Yeah, a straight gunner, but it feels strange
Yeah the things in my heart, makes things change
How I felt before makes my brain rearrange
And what I do it for is definitely not the same
Can I just take a minute?
Yeah, just wait a minute
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute
Or we could wait a minute
See how many times it just takes to say a minute
Life is so short, but we just take it for granted
Hand over my life and it was a life I was handed
Flying so high and, yes, I just landed
Im tryna figure out what my plan is
His hand is on my life, and my sin just vanished
My filth washes of quick like her fake tan is
I'm growing up quick like a grown man is
I'mma be set so will my great grand kids
Swag!!!!!

How do our lives become lighter ?
How do our eyes become brighter ?
You gotta believe in something higher
I never thought of forgiveness
Why do we really want to gain ?
Why won't we learn to be selfless ?
Wake away from all the shame
So take a look around and, you can settle down no
 blowing in the wind
So take a look around and, you can settle down no

When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancin' merrily
In the new old fashioned way
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voicеs singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck thе halls with boughs of holly!"

Sometimes it feels when i’m
When I’m with you, it’s ecstasy 
Sometimes it feels like we, met for a purpose, we’re meant to be 
And sometimes I feel like I can’t
Sometimes I feel like I can’t control it 
One step, two step, three, fourth step, start to see
It’s time to take things further 
And maybe you will be the one to set me free
I’m just waiting ‘til I know for sure
For sure, ‘til I know for sure , ‘til I know for sure 
For sure, ‘til I know for sure , ‘til I know for sure , for sure
I’m not gonna waste my time 
If things are just not going right 
For sure, ‘til I know for sure , ‘til I know for sure
Whenever you’re in my arms
It feels like it’s just a dream
I’m feeling you close to my heart and it blows me away
And everything will be okay
All I gotta see is your ways
I got so much love to give and it’s coming today

We can make it as long as we stay consistent
She looking for that special someone but tell me who isn’t?
Stuck in the middle, what ecstasy so wet it’s dripping?
I’m usually pimpin’ but tonight I pay you a visit
I knock on the door, she already ready
Model-type body, the genetics from granny
It’s going down, I got the world in my hands
I take you to Rome, way to pass the moon if I can
But anyway, the connection was unbreakable
So deep in that grip, ain’t no saving you
Ain’t nobody know about this situation
So turn off all the phones, no time for conversating
Looking in your eye is just like I travel back in time
I say to God I made her angry
You Heaven said I can't thank Him enough
To jump back into this world, is kinda testing your luck
But every now and then we get stuck, there’s broken trust
Mentally I thought we was perfect, the way we started
But mentally you got to my heart and then disregarded
For sure, ‘til I know for sure , ‘till I know for sure 
For sure, ‘til I know for sure , ‘til I know for sure , for sure
I’m not gonna waste my time 
If things are just not going right 

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the monеy and fame at an early age
And еverybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a—
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

It's like every time you fall
No one's gonna lend you a helping hand, oh
Wondering will you spend your life facing four walls
Like standing in quicksand, oh
Don't let your guard down, hold your head up
Life comes at you fast, gotta stay strong
I know what you can be cause underneath
You've had wings all along
And you've been travelling the same road for a long time
Feels like you're burning rubber going nowhere fast
I mean to tell you there's no limit to what you can do
You just gotta believe

Lyrics from snippet:
Careful not to bet this night away
Why things that are wrong feel so right?

What? Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand
We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It’s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, "Forever I'll be yours"
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you’re not there, woah?

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
When you was just a young’un you’re looks but so precious
But now you’re grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love

Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don’t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
I just want you to know

I never thought that it'd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh
And mama you were always somewhere, and daddy I live out of town
So tell how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best, so tell me why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here

I guess they want a reaction
But I ain't gonna give it to 'em

Ooh they been persistent tryna break me down
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can’t take what’s mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
Hoping you would change me, 
hoping you would make me lose my mind
)
Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna' get away, I'm good
, they try to break me
Hoping and praying I really won't make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me? How you gon' break me? 
I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz
, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in itthen they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it

Lyrics from Snippet
Said you're amazing
She said you must be crazy
I said, "No, I'm not, well, a little maybe"
And I don't talk a lot
But when I do, I mean it
And I swear I know an angel
Baby when I see you
I know I do have issues
But ain't got to do with you
Not gonna lie, girl, I miss you
No, it ain't superficial
We spent beautiful moments
And some beautiful dream
But ain't nothing more beautiful
Than you were next to me
And I got a couple things

Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do

Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them, he wears in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, I can not lie to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at, I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordon and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune?
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didn't write this
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And I'mma go right through you  and I'm so much cooler
And I don't need Luda
To know that I'm the ruler a
And I'm, so much cooler
You should call me Ferris Bueller

It's been a hot summer in the 90's and you're kids are about to be in school or already are
You're home alone and now it's time to jam
You are listening to Skrip's remix of Justin Beiber's "What Do You Mean?"
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

Oh, what a way to relive that song

You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

Now you tell me you need me

I need you, I need y-y-y-y-you the m-m-m
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord

And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody’s even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you’re making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 
Justin Bieber
]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tired of giving me warning

With you
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sittin' here, thinkin' "where is you now?"
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than it's gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you, I would go to war
I take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt

And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care
I got you, baby
See, we both fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts

But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See, like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place 
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do 
To fight with time and space 
I'm still stuck in the moment with you





As a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. 
I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes
, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance
Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended
I'm very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and 
I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake.
 I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again
Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always what's right
Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to 
those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man.
 Once again.... I'm sorry

My arms were made, were made to hold you
My lips were made to kiss you all over
My eyes were made to see your face

If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you ain’t never been before

Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really carе is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to bе the one who takes you home

She's got my attеntion, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confidеnt
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
You might also like
She said it's her first time 
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn 
And I don't know why
I'm addicted 
Something like an addict
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive 
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotised by the way you move
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no 
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time 
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn 
And I don't know why
I'm addicted 
Something like an addict
Got me twisted 

Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
You might also like
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
But maybe that's the price you pay
For the monеy and fame at an early age
And еverybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
You might also like
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me

Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely

First things first imma keep it real

Where'd the love go?
Where's the passion, oh?
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken
You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
You got me open, now we are broken
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken

Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
It's all good, it's all g
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
In the meantime, girls be around me
And I was so lost, until you found me
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight

Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight

Lyrics from snippet:
Move your body girl to the beat now
Move your body girl to the beat now
Hey girl pull up move your body
Turn right at me, shake that slowly

Surrounded with only noise
I seem to tune it out
I just wanna hear your voice

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over

And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah

Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear  was
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know there's something I can do
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life 
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

You called me, tried to shake the other line
In a hurry, know you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love
This journey will have its ups and downs
Su-sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while
First degree burns don't leave scars

Bernie Mac & Chorus Intro:
Stripping business started in Africa. Long time ago, long long time ago, white man went to Africa. And he saw all these bootiful  black women, walking around, singing, dancing, working, living, in the nude. Bucked Nakeds! In the nude. TITTIES! Asses
Verse:
Freddy Morris, I'm the topic of discussion
Big money touchin', countin' cash that's finger fuckin'
She gives me head, give me that brain, yeah that concussion
She spread her legs, pussy poppin' over this percussion
My granny said, "Son live for something or die for nothing"
I paint it rеd, no key start I'll the button
All my homies dеad Presidents, they got her lustin'
Interruption
I thought a broke nigga said something
Sayin' nothin'
Yea they're quiet as a mouse
You do it for the fame and do it for the clout
She don't do it for same, she's trying to make it out
Bossed up on a lame and kicked him out her house
Because he ain't hustlin', and that dick ain't payin' nothin'
Money make her cum, wet wet, keep her gushin'
Hermes clutchin', fresh bundles from her cousin
The hair is Russian, throw that ass in an eruption
Chorus:
(Money stays, It's stays on my mind -- Money, Money
All the time)
Money ain't shit without heart
In V.I.P the bottles came with sparks
I'm a light within the dark

Verse:
"Fuck you, Pay Me!" -- My only introduction
Time is money, so I'm always in a rush
And a businessman, no need for fighting no need for fussin'
But if it's smoke, Houston Texas known for bustin'
Times getting harder, grind and stack it for my daughter
The jewelry water, Blu diamonds like a Carter
On this beat I go retarted, slow money ya gotta pace it
I know you hate it, but God damn ya gotta face it
My pockets full of big faces, 200  on the dash
Don't want to race this, Bank account enraging racists
I'm on top now, no trading places
I clean my plate, bow my head and say my Graces
Money ain't shit without heart
In V.I.P the bottles came with sparks
I'm a light within the dark
Money ain't shit without heart
In V.I.P the bottles came with sparks
I'm a light within the dark

We got a number one Victory Royale
Yeah, Fortnite, we 'bout to get down 
Ten kills on the board right now
Just wiped out Tomato Town
My friend just got downed
I revived him, now we're heading south-bound
Now we're in the Pleasant Park streets
Look at the map, go to the marked sheet
Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake
I really love to Chug Jug with you
We can be pro Fortnite gamers
He said
"Hey broski, you got some heals and a shield pot?"
"I need healing and I am only at one HP"
Hey dude, sorry, I found nothing on this safari
I checked the upstairs of that house but not the underneath yet
There's a chest that's just down there
The storm is coming fast and you need heals to prepare
I've got V-Bucks that I'll spend
More than you can content
I'm a cool pro Fortnite gamer 
Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake

Can we get a win this weekend?
Take me to Loot Lake
Let's change the game mode and we can Disco Dominate
Let's hop in an ATK
Take me to the zone
I'm running kind of low on meds, I need to break some stone
Dressed in all his fancy clothes
He's got Renegade Raider and he's probably a pro
He just shot my back
I turn back and I attack
I just got a Victory Royale

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: "Home is where the heart is."
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand this
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remain
‘Causе all the rest dead; is thеre a spot for us to roll?
If you find it, I'll be right behind it, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm runnin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream "Peace!" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, uh
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place that’s right for me
Only place that's right for me

Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last

Lyrics from snippet:
Ah, wait a minute
Like I’m original when I can see you walk in it
See I’m an all-star all night, all in it
Me and Franny in the Maybach, all tinted
Look at you, Sin City, my pants silly
They know me, they don’t really know him really
Black bottles top off for top models
FL et cetera, the rest follows
Let’s see who car go the fastest
Who chick is the baddest, fuck Calabasas
The mansion with JB and T, pour it up when I pull up
So pull out the drinks going in, going up
She treat her like this
I see the dream real funny, if you dream on
Tell me you can dream on
Wait a minute, I ain’t even goin’ beat low
Whеn I get back, we can keep goin’
Well if you walk with mе
Well if you take my hand babe
We can go to a place you ain’t never seen before

Pull me, I can’t get enough
And when she do that dance
I’m a hell of a fan
Gotta give me the chance
To show you all of me
Open the door I got to

I'm crazy, yeah that's just what this game made me
I may need to replace these dumb faces
And maybe I need to refrain from the people who won't let me remain me
But I'm gonna still remain me

Lyrics from snippet:
Strong shoulders
Cold waters
Tryna bring me down
Yeah they wanna
Be noticed and I saw it
That's why I don't acknowledge

I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
It was more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
I'm the one you wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
'Cause I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, yeah, you're my kind of perfect
I don't work hard when it's easy

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint

Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave mе life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold mе, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud 
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds 
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud 
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up 
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust 
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us 
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

Para abrazarte todas las noches  Está más allá de una obsesión, tienes toda mi atención Nada se puede comparar a ti Esta vida es una locura Pero me llevó a tu amor Si me llamas por siempre vendré No importa qué, cariño De lo único que estoy seguro Será nuestro final cuando nuestros días dorados se hayan ido  Esta vida es una locura Pero me llevó a tu amor Si me llamas por siempre vendré No importa qué, cariño De lo único que estoy seguro Seremos diamantes cuando nuestros días dorados se hayan ido No importa qué, no importa qué  Somos solo nosotros  Sí, no importa qué...

They tell me love is blind
But baby I can see it all, tonight

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping

You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
