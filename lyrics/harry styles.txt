Sign of the Times Lyrics
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away

As It Was Lyrics
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

You know it's not the same as it was

You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

Falling Lyrics
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

Walk in your rainbow paradise

Fine Line Lyrics
Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
Ooh, ooh

Medicine Lyrics
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with it
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on my fingertips
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out
I'm feelin' it now 
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it

Kiwi Lyrics
She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it 
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it 
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your, it's none of your—" 
It's New York, baby, always jacked up 
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus 
In a black dress, 
she's such an actress
You might also like
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it 
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it

"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your business"

"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your, it's none of your—" 
Ow!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ah, la-la-la-la-la
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy drippin' on me till my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it 
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this 
It's none of your, it's none of your—
"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby" 
"It's none of your business" 
"Having your baby"

Matilda Lyrics
You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore
As long as you can let them go
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry, no

Cherry Lyrics
Coucou
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Lights Up Lyrics
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?

Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light

Browns my skin just right
You're so golden

You're so golden
I'm out of my head and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know

But I, I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote

Two Ghosts Lyrics
Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you, and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Tellin' those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half empty

We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half empty

Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat

Sweet Creature Lyrics
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But, oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

Just two hearts in one home
It gets hard when we argue

She Lyrics
Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away 
And not telling his mates 
He wouldn't know what to say 
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
She , she's the first one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is 
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head 
And she sleeps in his bed 
While he plays pretend 
So pretend

I don't know where she is 

Sunflower, Vol. 6 Lyrics
Sunflower
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower 
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight 
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you

I don't wanna make you feel bad

Tonight 
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight 
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied

Little Freak Lyrics
Little freak, Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you've become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
Did you dress up for Halloween?
I spilled beer on your friend, I'm not sorry
A golf swing and a trampoline
Maybe we'll do this again
Tracksuit and a ponytail
You hide the body all that yoga gave you
Red wine and a ginger ale
But you would make fun of me, for sure
You might also like
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
I disrespected you
Jumped in feet first and I landed too hard
A broken ankle, karma rules
You never saw my birthmark
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you

To Be So Lonely Lyrics
Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

To be so lonely, to be so

And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely

Late Night Talking Lyrics
Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you, mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through
If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming, too
If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happiеr, baby

Boyfriends Lyrics
Hoo
Niaga ti ta kcab er'uoy, loof
Boyfriends, they think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know, they're just misunderstanding
You
You, you're back at it again
Weakened when you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only callin' you when
He don't wanna be alone
Oh, and you go
But why? You don't know

Boyfriends, are they just pretending?
They don't tеll you where it's heading
And you know thе game's never ending
You
You lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You
Feel a fool, you're back at it again

Daylight Lyrics
I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleedin'
Looking for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight 
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight 
Daylight, you got me calling at all times 
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight 
Out of New York
I'm on the comedown speed
We're on bicycles
Saying, "There's life out therе"
You've got the antidote
I'll takе one to go, go, please
Get the picture, cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now

From the Dining Table Lyrics
Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name

Love Of My Life Lyrics
Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin' for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news, but it's on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin' someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place, it's not the same anymore
Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wantеd, to leave you behind
Don't know whеre you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life
It's unfortunate 
Just coordinates 
I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?

Keep Driving Lyrics
​
Black-and-white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ash tray, swimming pool
Hot wax, jump off the roof
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?"
Maple syrup, coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown, egg yolk
I will always love you
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?"
"Should we just keep driving?"
Passports in foot wells
Kiss her and don't tells
Wine glass, puff pass
Tea with cyborgs
Riot America
Science and edibles
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom
Cocaine, side boob
Choke her with a sea view
Toothache, bad move
Just act normal
Moka pot Monday
It's all good
Hey, you

Should we just keep driving?

Cinema Lyrics
You got, you got the cinema
It's you
And I'm not gettin' over it
Darling, is it cool
If I'm stubborn when it comes to this?
I guess we're in time
If you're getting yourself wet for me
I guess you're all mine
When you're sleeping in this bed with me
I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool, too?
Or am I too into you?
Tell me what you want and you got it, love
I want all of you, gimme all you got
That's cinema
That's cinema, uh-huh
It's you
Don't know why, but it feels so right to me
Something in the way you move
I like it when you dance for me 
You all the time 
In doses at night 
No roof on the drive
Dust off the high

Music for a Sushi Restaurant Lyrics
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah 
You're sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted 'round your tongue
I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you
It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, babe

Only Angel Lyrics
I saw this angel
 
I really saw an angel
 
Hey, hey
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home 
to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it
She's an angel , only angel 
She's an angel , my only angel 
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meetin' in the hallway every single time
And there's nothin' we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it, hey, hey

Ever Since New York Lyrics
Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
And I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

Meet Me in the Hallway Lyrics
Two, three, four
Meet me in the hallway
Meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom
Give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out
I walked the streets all day
Running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway
 
Just take the pain away

I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better

'Cause once you go without it
Nothing else will do

Grapejuice Lyrics
One, two, three
One, two—
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
"Give me something old and red"
I pay for it more than I did back then
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
Sittin' in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we'vе been
You're always there, so don't ovеrthink
I'm so over whites and pinks

Woman Lyrics
Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?
I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen
I hope you can see the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're makin' me bleed
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman

Apologies are never gonna fix this

I got a girl crush
I hate to admit it, but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh

Carolina Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
She's got a family in Carolina 
So far away, but she says I remind her of home 
Feelin', oh, so far from home 
She never saw herself as a West Coaster 
Moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her 
"Townes, better swim before you drown" 
She's a good girl 
She's such a good girl 
She's a good girl 
She feels so good 
She's got a book for every situation 
Gets into parties without invitations 
How could you ever turn her down? 
There's not a drink that I think could sink her 
How would I tell her that she's all I think about? 
Well, I guess she just found out

Canyon Moon Lyrics
Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going

Woo

Now you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on it's getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be
I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two
I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go, 
'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand

Candles burnt down
 to the floor
Wearing less than you wore before
Shoes sitting by the door
Never put them on
We would stay in my house for days
Spilling breakfast on pillowcases
Your stuff don’t taste the same
Now that you’re gone
I guess I’m prone to overthinking
One thing goes wrong and I can’t adjust
I’ve lost the taste for the good in us
And I’m sorry
We had a hunger then
Only each other then
Couldn’t get enough
 when we started
Always a hunger then
Now it’s just emptiness
We 
were in love,
 
we were starving
We had a hunger then
We could ruin a perfect night
On my birthday I made you cry
You told me you learned to drive
I guess you lied
I could never get sick of you
I just bit off more than I could chew
And 
as one year turns into two
I’m still not over you

Yeah, looks like we've made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there some day
They say, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We’re still together, still going strong, oh
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
Glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

Well I think I wrote a song
That all your friends are gonna like
But they'll tell you that they hate it
When they don’t just because it’s mine
And I swear that I’m not thinking about you all the time

Summer's death was left to breath
Smell the change and burning peels

Now that we’re done
I wish I wasn’t leaving
We've said it before
Each time with different meaning
I found out too late
This is what you wanted
And there’s no parade
No one to watch me falling down
And as my body hits the ground
Doesn’t make a sound
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
Thought I’d be fine
To get through the night
Alone on the hotel floor
It’s gonna be long
It’s gonna be hard
It’s gonna be painful

Living like we used to do
I don’t wanna wait

Do we have to change?
Can’t we stay the same?
Living like we used to do
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
I know we’ll move on
As time carries on
I still leave an open door

These lines
Make it hard for me, honestly I
Think I'm blind half of the time
And it's gettin' harder to see them
When you are bruised but you can't see it, do you forget how much it hurts at the time?
When you're just starting to feel it
I'm shit scared to think it'd be here right now
If I never let you down
Life
Will fault you by design
High tides
And there's you
Lookin' lost in a hospital bed
Week at mine of guilt in your cryin'
I think you wanted to keep it
Kills me to think that I let you down
Now you're scared in your hometown
Life
Will fault you by design
And time
Can take you by surprise

You're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey
I'm gonna try honey
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
Hold on
Hold on







Close your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And I’m hoping you don’t shout about it
Now I know a bunch of people who would waste your time
But I wouldn’t let it happen to a friend of mine
We could write ourselves a story without doing lines
‘Cause believe me, we can live without it
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
Broke a finger knocking on my bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling on the floor
Could never take you home because your skirt’s too short
And your mother would be mad about it
I must admit I married you a thousand times
Had to change my tune when I found out what it’d be like
But I meet you in the hallway almost any time
And we won’t have to talk about it, ah, hey
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel

Told it to her brother, to her mother and me
That she wants to be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And, believe me, I am all about it
Painted on your back, I knew we’d get along
But I caught you in the mirror staring way too long
I could love her if I didn’t think I’d do it wrong
I’m gonna have to take you home, hey
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel

I just wanna love you, that's all I gotta say
Empty pages, but the words are on the way
Selfish, crazy and I'm never gonna change
At least I'm honest with you, babe
Do you regret it?
Talking to me late night
I'm getting heavy
You know what it feels like
Shouldn't have said it
Tell me it don't feel alright
I just wanna love you
I just wanna fall right in
I just wanna love you
I just wanna fall all in
I just wanna love you
I just wanna fall again

Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you

With your gold sunglasses and a

Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I’m fragile, I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
'Cause I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won’t be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

With your sleepy eyes

I jump into knee deep water
But I’m sinking, somehow
Trouble on every corner
But you’re all I need now
You, you give me something
What it is I just don’t know
But I feel like a time bomb ticking
And without you I might blow
You give me the feeling
You give me a hiding place
Our love is bitter
But I really like the taste
Who said it was easy
Taking it day by day
But always remember
That I’ll love you anyway
You make it feel right
Oh Oh Ooh Oh Oh Ooh

You don’t wanna hear my tiny violin
You don’t wanna hear my explanation
They make me feel wanted, make me come fast
The hottest of fire’s still cold when it’s ash
I make lots of money, build a big house
Put an extra sink in, say I’ll settle down
Friends call me a loner, I know they’re wrong
She asked me to choke her, I play along
Hit me like a ray of light, straight to my veins
Hit me with a real life and that’s when I’ll change
If the grass isn’t greener, if the song’s out of tune
It’ll all go away whеn it comes to you
You won’t have the answеrs to all my questions
I’ll piss you off, won’t learn my lesson
I don’t want you perfect
Don’t want you sweet
But you make my day and make my whole week
Hit me like a ray of light, straight to my veins
Hit me with a real life and that’s when I’ll change
If the grass isn’t greener, if the song’s out of tune

I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink oh love
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18…



Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she



Ha-ha

Tokyo, Tokyo 
Fantasising like people do

Why don't we get a little higher?

Hello, I’m Harry Styles, and tonight I’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music. A sleep story just for you. With all the business of your day, I know how hard it can be to go to sleep. So, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you. I wish you a wonderful night sleep. So make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out. In, and then out. And when you’re ready, close your eyes
Have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look
Tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. Settle back and clear your mind. We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial
I’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies
Think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. The power of the universe meanders through your mind. So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find
Let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever. Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms
A gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity
Picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream
Dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. Occasionally they kiss our cheeks. Small pleasures; quenching needs
Holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; love
Now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by
The wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost
Passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers
You might also like
Strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies
The fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift
Sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur
We find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones
The stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer
Strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go
Contemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us. And as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within
Glistening snowflakes fall in flurries. Mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees. Somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you
We linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers. Another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems. Perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams
Drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare. A path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean. Now, within our reach
Eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet. The sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat. We hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread
Finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet. It seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat. We dig our toes in cool, wet sand. Then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us. Alone, just you and me
Staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together. As minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through
Imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon. Birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers. Hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk
The sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view. As we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone. Its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone
A garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass. A bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past. We wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer. The thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger
This feeling washes over us, lost between a sight. And as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me. Then, the scene begins to fade on new reality
Deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places. Too surreal to comprehend. Slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call. Entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall
Friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots. Some of me, and some of you. Moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion
The tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us. But, we’ve only just begun. For now, we dream together of all that is to follow. And now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow
Maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight. No matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever. And every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure
Goodnight, and sleep well

Paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop)
Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

5280 miles away from you
Sky outside my window is black and yours is blue
And soon the summertime will come along
Take the clouds to bring the light
And you've done the same for me a thousand times
'Cause everybody needs someone to hold on to
'Cause everybody needs someone like you
There's 50 thousand people here, give or take a few
But if there's something missing here, that thing is you
And the moon pulls on thе ocean
It separates us now
You nеver told who to love, but you showed me how

Cameron called to tell me
He saw you falling over
I guess you still can’t hold your red wine
I always could hold you though
Corsica
, Morocco
The way that dress adores you, sunshine
Cause you like a certain life
Spending money all the time
You’re so fancy on the eyes
But you’ve been told too many times
You can’t do the things you like
Cause you’re easy on the eyes
There’s a part of me
No one ever sees
Cause I’ll always bе
A little in between
Would’ve givеn you everything
But you took a little piece
And that part of me
Is yours to keep
Part of me is yours
You found someone like you though
Found a man named Theo
Worked out for the best now don’t you see
I just hope you know it
Cause I still love the moment all the same
You don’t like a modern life
So can we just go back in time
To a red route ‘65

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy

You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, "What a goddess" 
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest 
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris
Fuck the government and fuck Boris
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce, don't know what you thought
Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
I don't fuck with her
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie, way too exclusive
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit

Mummy sayin' that I need to get some sleep
All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
And all this stress has got me wreckin' up my brain 
So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name 
I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
Cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game, straight
Baddin' up the game, bad it up again
Had 'em up before, have 'em up again 
Fake bruddas, man, your mandem all pretend
Pussy by himself, he's badder with his friends, aww
You man are so insecure, man, it's a joke 
I need a Ballon d'Or, 'cause I'm the GOAT

Told her "Save me some"

So you were right
There’s always two
The one who stays, and the one who’s leaving you
Hear me out, my apologies
‘Cause I’m not here for sympathy
‘Cause I don’t want to hear about him
How he’s holding you better at night
And I don’t want to hear about him
In these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
So I don’t want to hear about him
That nice dress in my Wildest Dreams
Lipstick stains you left still on my sheets
When I hear 
“amazing eyes”
It breaks my heart evеry time
‘Cause I don’t want to hear about him
How hе’s holding you better at night
And I don’t want to hear about him
In these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
So I don’t want to hear about him
You might also like
Do you know what it’s like to fall in love from the outside
And I don’t know but I've been trying for you, for me
Now I know what it’s like to fall in love from the outside
I…
So I don’t want to hear about him
How he’s holding you better at night
I don’t want to hear about him
And these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
I don’t want to hear about him
Is he holding you better at night?
Is it me running into your mind?
I still think about you all the time

After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know, I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelеssly devoted to you
My head is saying, "Fool, forgеt him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go
Hold on 'til the end"
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to

She got wrapped up in somebody else
I’m wrapped up stuck in love with myself

But I miss her skin on me now
Tip of my tongue, she’s pulling my hair

Back seat of the car and up in the air
But I miss how she kissed everywhere

I can’t get you off my mind
I still crave it, complicated freak

Gonna turn the light on to see something new
Can’t always rely on what we thought was true
Baby, don’t you know I’ve been waiting for you
Now that I have found you, got something to lose
This might sound crazy
'Cause I just lost my mind, mind, mind
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
I’ve been here for years wasting love, wasting time
Those days were a blur and the nights passed me by
Baby, don’t you know that I’d wait all my life
Now that I am sure that you’re real it’s alright
This might sound crazy
'Cause I just lost my mind, mind, mind
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’re something I’vе been waiting for
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’rе something I’ve been waiting for
You’re everything I need and more
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You might also like
Won’t let go, won’t let you go
Won’t let go, won’t let you go
Won’t let go, won’t let you go, won’t let go, won’t let go
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’re something I’ve been waiting for
You’re everything I need and more

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away

Got me looking at London lights
Wishin' you were here with me
In these London lights
Saying that you love how I got
Hazel eyes
And honestly I won't catch up on sleep tonight
I'll be lookin' at London lights
And missing you

When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, “I bet they'll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You might also like
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing
They said, “I bet they'll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
I'm so glad we made it



All you dreamers won’t die
Feel no fear you’re older now
Keeping the freeze of the cold air out
You’ve been having the time of your life
So celebrate
Here we go again
There goes another year
I don’t feel at home anymore
But at least I made a couple friends
There goes another year
Went over my head
Jesus we can talk through the door
I don’t wanna come in anyway
Well I was awake at the start of the world
And I’ll be alone in the back of a hearse
There’s no stopping me now
There’s just no stopping me now
Here we go again
There goes another year
Maybe we don’t talk anymore
But at least we can be kinda friends
There goes another year
Went over my head
Jesus we can talk through the door
I don’t wanna come in anyway
But I know that I’ll be back again
I’m coming back again

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks & 
Harry Styles
]
I took my love, I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Till the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
[Chorus: Stevie Nicks and Harry Styles and 
Stevie Nicks
]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yes, I'm getting older too
[Chorus: Stevie Nicks and Harry Styles and 
Stevie Nicks
]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yes, I'm getting older too

[Outro: Stevie Nicks &

Oh, take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down
, down
And if you 
see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh









Scotty, can’t you see?
You’re the guy i wish i could be
The stories, the drawing, all of your books
I’ll take it all over my good looks
The pressure
To be the coolest in class
It’s not worth it and i know it won’t last
And yes i’ve had sex and it feels great
The girls body, the butt, the shape, it’s amazing
I ride like no other
Except for when you're hanging with your brother
But back to sex, such a good feeling
Call me pig boy ‘cause you know i be squealin’
Back to you number one big bro
I love you scotty, just had to let you know

You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
Nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
