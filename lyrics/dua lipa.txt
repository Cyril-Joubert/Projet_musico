New Rules Lyrics
One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
You might also like
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart 
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse
 and repeat it 'cause I 
One, don't pick up the phone 
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone 
Two, don't let him in 
You'll have to kick him out again 
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em (
Woah, oh
)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em (
Baby, you know I count 'em
)
I gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him

Scared to Be Lonely Lyrics
It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
You might also like
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh, ooh
Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely

Don’t Start Now Lyrics
If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
You might also like
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up , don't come out 
Don't start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Don't start caring about me now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

IDGAF Lyrics
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
You might also like
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck

Levitating Lyrics
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Blow Your Mind  Lyrics
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

Break My Heart Lyrics
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
You might also like
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no , I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Kiss and Make Up Lyrics
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa, 
Rosé
]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up

Levitating  Lyrics
Billboard Baby, Dua Lipa make 'em dance when it come on
Everybody lookin' for a dancefloor to run on
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy

Physical Lyrics
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on 
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Electricity Lyrics
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I’m with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I’ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

We’re Good Lyrics
I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
You might also like
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Homesick Lyrics
Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you
You might also like
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

Love Again Lyrics
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You might also like
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

Hotter Than Hell Lyrics
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock
He can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You'd probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

You ain't gonna walk free, boy
Not finished with you yet, no
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?

And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

Boys Will Be Boys Lyrics
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be

When will we stop saying things

Fever Lyrics
Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? 
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne m'y vois pas
Comme un médicament, moi, je suis rien sans toi
Et je sais quе j'essaie, que jе perds du temps dans tes bras
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?

La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit

Thinking ’Bout You Lyrics
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through

Slip under my bed and keep me up

Pretty Please Lyrics
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (
Gonna break, gonna break
)
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

Good in Bed Lyrics
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
You might also like
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to 
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when you're going down, I get so up 
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other 
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist 
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please , come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad 
We drive each other mad 
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
Yeah, we don't know how to talk 
But damn, we know how to fuck
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad 
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head 
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad

Houdini Lyrics
Okay
Mm, ah

Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me

Genesis Lyrics
In the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth, for what it's worth
I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
You might also like
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition
Tells me that I'm doing you wrong, if I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
You know
I'll roar like a lion
For you
You know I'll keep trying
Till the sun stops rising
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Lost in Your Light Lyrics
Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby

Torture tempted with pleasure

You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Swan Song Lyrics
I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Ooh, my outfit so tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight

Last Dance Lyrics
Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You might also like
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

New Love Lyrics
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad
You might also like
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

No Goodbyes Lyrics
Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (
No goodbyes
)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (
All alright
)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (
No goodbyes
)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
You might also like
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (
No goodbyes
)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (
All alright
)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (
No goodbyes
)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes 
No goodbyes 
No goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (
All alright
)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (
No goodbyes
)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

Want To Lyrics
I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight

Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to 

Garden Lyrics
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(
Eden, Eden, Eden
)
This Garden of Eden?
(
Eden, Eden, Eden
)

I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know

I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

Bad Together Lyrics
Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say

Training Season Lyrics
Are you
Someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
Play fair
Is that a compass in your nature?
Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice
But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Convеrsation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
Arе you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
You might also like
I tried
To see my lovers in a good light
Don't wanna do it just to be nice
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right
I hope
It hits me like an arrow
Someone with some potential
Is it too much to ask for?
Who understands I
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
Can you compete? Now is your time
Run when you hear that whistle blow
Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines
Waiting for someone to tell you to go?
For someone to tell you to go
You should know I
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul 
Conversation overload
'Cause training season's over
'Cause training season's over 
Training season's over

Begging Lyrics
All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
You might also like
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind 
of
 love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever

High Lyrics
You don't have to be so cautious if you practice what you preach
Counting up the stacks on the counter, a fucking disease
Don't ask me to be righteous if you practice what you teach
Counting all your blessings the second you're down on your knees
So why, why
Don't we get a little high, high?
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high
Keep my head under the water, pride buried in my chest
Not counting all the minutes, the seconds, not holdin' my breath
Now sinking from the surface, swimming in my lungs
Losing all my vision, religion, I'm holding my tongue
So why, why
Don't we get a little high, high?
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high
You might also like
Don't wanna pay attention to the writing on the wall
Painted with aggression, and dripping when you call
Not gonna learn my lesson, am I running out of time?
So, why, why, why?
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high

Room for 2 Lyrics
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through
You might also like
Up and down, it all comes back around

Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Last night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying

And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know

That Kind of Woman Lyrics
One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops and it's not me to be one
To be one, one of many
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking, I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking, I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya
One out here for ya
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still
Let me show ya, that kind of woman 
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still
Any longer, that kind of woman
I'll pick you from the crowd, don't come to me
I want you to myself
, no, I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one, one of many

 Keep you close, next to me, I won't let you go
 Reminisce that you once met a girl like this
The first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
 
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman

If It Ain’t Me Lyrics
I bet we're higher than the people on Cloud 9
This connection got me feeling like I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So why do I think of losing you when you're right by my side? Uh
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up
So baby, don't you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever 
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks on my imagination, ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna tell me it's goodbye, uh
You might also like
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up
So baby, don't you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever 
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear 
Like what if you left me here 
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears? 
So baby, don't you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever 
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me

Not My Problem Lyrics
We doin' good
We doin' good
That's your problem
Pulling me down like an anchor
Sayin' it's my fault, you're angered
Telling me no one will love me 
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
You and me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that 
Now it's my turn to bite back 
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & 
JID

Ooh, did it to yourself 
Playing with my mind 
Putting me through hell (

Ooh, I'd be broken too 
If you left me like  like I left you
That's your problem
[Chorus: Dua Lipa &

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out
Ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind now
Than to see you walk away from me
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody еlse
As long as you swear you won't be pissеd when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

So don't give me that, just say we're good

So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

Running Lyrics
You, you turned gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, words pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Every time we out on a date, we're engaging
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her "What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?"
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in 
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here, yeah we having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Well, boy, I don't give a...

I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck

What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?

But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear

I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I’m all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Lyrics from snippet
When I put my hands in the air
Look, look, I move like this
When I put my leg up back, forth, back
Look, look, I move like this
When I let my hips sink way, way, down
Look, look, I feel like this
When I flip my hair like up, down, to the middle
I'm a rockstar, just a little
Pay attention, grow up
I'm educatin'

True love one way or another
I feel let down just a little bit

One day we partied, we livin'
The next I'm down in my feelings
So hurt, my heart is a-bleeding

You can tell all the freaks
How you carried my body home
But tonight I crossed the line
Dear Mr. Lonely
How much could you know me?
I could find lessons in light
But once you've earned it
You've already burned it

I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
Woo!

Got my ticket man and I'm looking
For somebody to use it
I know we pretend
But one of these days
We're gonna lose it
And I once left town
When the leaves turned brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car
When we hit that wall
Yeah it could've move me to tears
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
But once it's over, it's all really over

I don't wanna see you go

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Scared to be lonely

I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of losing you
And you're right by my side, huh
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up
So baby don't you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke

Ain't no way I can run without you
Every ghost in my past life held my hand when I crashed down
Carries me when I wanna break through

And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything

 Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'

Gotta get something off of my chest, can I get a witness?
Yeah, I got tattoos all on my skin, but scared of commitment
And I keep saying that I love you, I wish you would listen
I wish you would listen
But there's something missin', mh
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (

If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (

Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Tonight, she yelling, "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me

But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong

The more I love you, the more I rip you apart
That's what you said when we were arguing
I gave you so much love, I left none for myself
And you took it all away and threw it right back, right back

You're acting like a fool
I'm allowed to hang out with my friends and without you
You're so in denial 
And I'm so over you 
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me

I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

And you think you sick, now you 'bout to get much sicker
'Cause I'm lookin' in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Bacon, baby, here's what's poppin', rich with six-plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, takin' meetings in LA
Glowin' up and blowin' up, that's what I'm 'bout to do

Go find a girl who wants to listen

You have got me wrong

'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on

Sign off on our connection, then I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept it hunnid, man, you shoulda kept it real
'Cause I realized you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
'Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur
Cut you off, I don't need your love

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa + 
Gallant

All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right
We were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
And knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me but to walk away
I have no capacity
[Chorus 1: Dua Lipa + 
Gallant

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
[Verse 2: Dua Lipa + 
Gallant
]
I don't understand
Why do I stress the man when there's so many bigger things at hand?
We coulda never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spilling drinks on my settee
Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go, was sorta hoping that you'd stay
Baby, we both know that the nights are mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up

Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you
Feel the same as I do
We could be together
If you wanted to
Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go, was sorta hoping that you'd stay
Baby, we both know that the nights are mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

If you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone
Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you
I'd fight for you
When you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear

When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight?
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

You don't know what you've lost 'til it's gone
You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise

And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

Houdini  Lyrics
I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Evеrybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini

Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay
Everything you say is soundin' so sweet 
But do you practice everythin' that you preach? 
I need somethin' that'll make me believe 
If you got it, baby, give it to me
Weave the ceilin' from tomorrow
Free the people from daylight
All the plans go out the window
When we're out this late at night
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go 
Prove you got the right to please me

Wait a minute, uh
You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
[Chorus: Dua Lipa & 
Ant Clemons

Act of God
, don’t know how it started
Now I'm boutta 
lose at all

I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate

Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire 
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine 
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused 
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you

Act of God

Wait a minute, uh
I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
Et depuis quelque temps nos relations n’sont pas terribles
Pourtant, je te console comme on le voit dans les films
Comment tu veux qu’j’le prenne quand tu m’appelles "mon chéri"
Alors qu’il y a quelques minutes on était comme sur un ring ?
Et tu sais bien qu’j’aime pas qu’on se prenne la tête devant nos amis
Alors prends ta veste et rejoins-moi tout de suite derrière la son-mai
J’crois qu’il est temps qu'on récolte tout ce qu’on a semé
Depuis toutes ces années, on s’demandait où ça nous menait

Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est ça ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
Même quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up 
'Cause if you think I care about you now

Je me fous de c'qu'elle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a fuck
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?

Feels like we're all alone but we're here in a crowded room
Your eyes all on me and my eyes are looking right at you
Feels like I've known you for a lifetime but it's just day two
So into you 
Something about you in the way that you just say my name
It makes me wanna throw my hands up 'cause you know I'm game
Wanna unlock the movies I got playin' in my brain 
Of you and me 
Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you
I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else 
I want you all to myself 
All to myself , all to myself 
Up in the canyon with the flowers, they were all in bloom
Your hand on the lower part of my back, so close to you
You know the feeling when you're falling?
Well, I fell for you 
You know it's true 
You might also like

Oh, oh
While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of broken dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me are we meant to be
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing
You might also like
All or nothing

Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time 
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness

Drifting away, should I leave and let us break?
Torn, torn apart, left a hole in my heart
I know we might shatter in time, I lost my mind
They say that I should let you go
Tell me I shouldn’t throw
Bricks at my own window
Love in a tornado, bullets in a barrel cage
Roses in a fire, screaming into silence
Diamonds back to coal again
But I wouldn't have it any other
Way, way, way
Staying beside ya, roses in a fire
Stone, stone cold
Only you can warm my soul
Bones turn to dust
Locked away, left untouched

Cab radio screaming
Noise and tears
Death on the TV
And then there's you
Messed up, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline...
Mhmm
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh

Met a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Another thing that he told me
"It’s gonna be a long, long daylight"
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase

Ain’t nothing stopping me

Get a little naughty
Girl, you're drunk on FaceTime
WiFi's gettin' sloppy

I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
Masks can be irritating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: There's a new third base, that's when you get to see their lower face
Two:  Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick 'em when you wake up in the morning
You're feelin' numb, it's you, your hand, and OnlyFans
We've got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
It's your neighbors you're saving
You'll get that touch you're craving
Just follow these rules for dating

Sippin' on that purple lean
Gangsta boy got me so mean
Come, let’s get a little wilder
Let's wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
I promise you, you'll never forget
What it feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
I'll kiss all the ink on your neck
'Cause baby, you do it, and you do it the best
Light up, let's get a little louder
Hold me for a little longer
I love it when you whisper in my ear
Tell me things I always wanna hear

Love Is Religion   Lyrics
I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion
There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause
You might also like
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Put your hands together and close your eyes
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
This is Yaeji and you're listening to Club Future Nostalgia
They say love is religion
If you don't wanna see me

Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now
 
Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now
Heavy like the bass-line
Way past “Good Girl” bed time
Had too much, drunk as fuck
Swaying to those red lights
On my worst behavior
Making out with strangers
Dusty buzz, feel the rush
Speeding through my head
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me

Dirty like the dance-floor
Psychedelic candy store
In a transe, dizzy stance
I got what you’re looking for
Naughty indication, give into temptation
Late at night, what a high
When we conversate
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It’s all over me
Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight 
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now 
Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight

Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
If you're good enough, you'll find the way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay
Everything you say is soundin' so sweet
But do you practise everythin' that you preach?
I need something that'll make me believe
If you got it, baby, give it to me

I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
Make my heart run back and forth
You’re everything I want and more
I think you’re down but I’m not sure
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
And I like that, kinda like that
Make it hard to talk and see
I'm just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they’re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me

I look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing
Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow

Slipped away like grains of sand
Couldn't hold you long enough in my hands
Can't remember how it went from good to bad
Now I just reminisce, I just reminisce on everything we had
The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That feels like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I never meant for it to end this way (
End this way
)
I wish that I could say this face to face (
Face to face
)
Holding on for hope your mind would change (
Mind would change

'Cause I want you back (
Want you back

I need you back to take this pain away (
Take this pain away

But I can't get no sleep, I can't get no rest

I don't wanna guess what you're thinking tonight
I want the facts, I don't want no more lies

Guilty, guilty, guilty
Took myself out for dancing, a little romancing
I’m learning to be alone
Left that sadness behind me, won’t let it define me
I’m on my own, no
I don’t have to tell you where I’m going
Who I’m going with or when I’ll be back home
Back home
Feeling guilty ‘cause I feel so good
‘Cause I feel so good
Guilty ‘cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn’t feel so guilty
‘Cause I did no wrong, I’m just having fun
You’re the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I’m the guilty one
We could blame it on timing, if that justifies it
But we have to let go
This new rhythm I’m finding
Is helping me find me
I hope you do too

Lyrics from Snippet
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Don't you wear your own mouth?
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think you'd ever change?
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care

And I tried, and I tried, and I tried
But it just doesn't feel right
Like a night, like a night, like a night
With a sunrise
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
You are looking two faced

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I'm levitating
[Verse 2: Sukriti Kakar & 
Dua Lipa
]
Chal chale aisi agah aa na pai koi jaha
Show me what you feel inside
Hona hai jo ho jaaye woh keh de mujhei dil
Mujhei karna yu muah sei hide

Shining just the way we are

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
Need you, hold me tight, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I'm levitating
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride 
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

Come on, dance with me

I told myself "I'd never let it hurt me”
Been wasting tears on things that don’t deserve me
Blessed with the curse to feel as deeply as I do
I’m compromised and losin’ all my senses
Give me the rush, but easy on the tension
Oh, here it comes, that kind of blue I'm so used to
It’s one of those nights
I’m up and can’t get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself
“Some days are gonna be, gonna be hardеr
Than the rest of them, baby
Than thе rest of them, but it’s alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright"
I know the taste of when it starts to creep in
It's bittersweet to make it out the deep end
So hard to see it's brighter on the other side

Troubled nights, a troubled guy
With nothing but entitlement behind his eyes
I wish I saw right through the lies
In that disguise, so criminal
Words can cut deep like a knife
And I know that you did it all, all out of spite
You tried to pull me down
When I was ridin’ high, hypocritical
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
He who comes, he who goes
There’s nothing like a boy with a, a bruisin' soul
Who runs their mouth as if he knows
So critical, so critical

Do ya know what I mean?
You only seen the cover, you ain't open the book
Know that you would like him if you just take a look
There's nothing you can do, 'cause I'm already hooked
I got this, I got this
 You ain't gotta worry 'cause he love me for me
I know he got my back, he's the boy of my dreams
I'm better when I'm with him and I wish you could see
I got this, I got this
You should feel good, he treats me right
Thought that you'd have an open mind
This love is more than just a night, a night
And you can't tell me nothing
I do, I do, I do what I like
Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine

I got poison in my feet
One more hit to knock you down
All my love is out of reach
Taste my lips, I'll watch you drown
Round, and round, and round we go
Do you like the pain I bring?
Tied a  around your soul
And you will fight it
I'm no saint, I've never been
I will never let you win
I will always make you cry
Cause I'm a hooligan, hooligan
Sail away, don't be a fool again, fool again
Try to heal, but I'm not born again, born again
Can only love you like a hooligan, hooligan
You keep coming back to hurt
Call it stupid call it dumb
'Cause all this trouble made you numb
You might also like
Round, and round, and round we go

I will always make you cry
Cause I'm a hooligan, hooligan
Sail away, don't be a fool again, fool again
Try to heal, but I'm not born again, born again
Can only love you like a hooligan, hooligan
Ooh ooh, I'm an angel off to sin
Ooh ooh, there's no remedy within
Ooh ooh, can only love you like a hooligan
I never meant to make you cry
Make you cry, make you cry
It's just the way I'm made inside, inside
No matter what I do

Every night I prayed for, prayed for clarity
All while you were lying right there next to me
You barely even noticed I was losing sleep
You barely even noticed you were losing me, mmm
Don't say shit to me
Don't say a word to me
Don't ask me to change
Don't want your heart to break
Words don't hurt no more
I heard it all before
Don't ask me to change
Don't want your heart to break

Is it just that you're so damn oblivious?
Or is it just that you don't take me serious? 
Counting my excuses more than millions 
Boy, I'm done with it, done with it, done with it
I don't even know what I'm doing here
Don't say shit to me
Don't say a word to me

All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you

I want you to stay, I want you to stay

Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Walking alone and the shores are longing
I miss your footprints next to mine
Sure as the waves on the sand are washing
Your rhythm keeps my heart in time

I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion
There's a fire rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause
You might also like
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
 Put your hands together and close your eyes
 Put your hands together and close your eyes
 Put your hands together and close your eyes
 Put your hands together and close your eyes
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion
They say love is religion

Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? 
Every time you're close, I get out of breath
Wondering, wondering, wondering what'll happen next
Oh, is it my imagination? It's got my heart beat racing
Fallin' in, fallin' in, fallin' in, feel it in my chеst
I've got a fever, so can you chеck?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? 
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now, now, now, now
Tell me what you wanna do right now

Good people do bad things too
Pretend they don't know but they do
It takes one to know your mind
You and me, we are one of a kind, it's true
I like to my feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like to taste the blood when you're tearin' me apart
And though I won't resist your touch you got me losing my mind
Borderline, hey
Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
You're wrong but you're feeling so right
No other love felt like you
Your madness bringing out mine
Crazy finds lovе in crazy too

Kiss and Make Up   Lyrics
Future Nostalgia
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & 
Rosé
]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

아무런 말도 넌 하지 마
마지막은 없어

Maybe I'm miseducated
Lauryn Hill mistaken
Looking up at the sun, so my mind awakens
I'm running wild, tryna find the light
Tell me, baby, are you with me or just for the night?
I'm hurting, aching
Slowly fading, breaking
The haze is filling my mind, like it's medicating
Playing with fire, 'til our hands are tied
Falling for you's the definition of suicide
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”
Never get high off your own supply
Never get high off your own supply

Guess I'm stubborn with you

Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me
“Never get high off your own supply”
Never get high off your own supply
Never get high off your own supply
Mmm 
I can’t feel my face from my mistakes
And all the things I’ve tried to hide
Can’t feel my face, just took one taste
And then we wasted our supply
I can’t feel my face, can’t feel my face
And all the things I, I, I, I can’t feel my face
I can’t feel my face
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened

Moving too fast, they say it won’t last
But I just wanna
Yeah, I just wanna see for myself
The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
‘Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh
I been waiting for you, been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know whеn the time is right

In the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Just say you forgive me and don't let me go
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough

You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun stops rising
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in

Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby
I wanna do more (

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Blood on my hands, 'cause I'm in love
With more than one man and have to give one up
Charged guilty and light me up
'Cause I can't choose the one I want
One for the night, one for the road
I'm gonna drown myself in liquor to let go
One for the night, before they close
To sooth the darkness, all the darkness in my soul
One for the night
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
One more tonight
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through 
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in 
Cold, cold heart
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my—
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, hеad
We drive each othеr mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better

Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras, sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?
Gigolo
Huh, sucka?
Gigolo, gigolo
Huh, sucka?
Gigolo

Physical  Lyrics
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on 
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree? 
Don't you agree? 
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nicе 
Living it up

Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice

We are runaways, so we misbehave
And your mama warned you to stay away
I don't wanna leave your humanity
But we were fallin' in water and then we found the sea
There's just two of us, and it's true of me
And the lost by the society
Had to sacrifice, had to roll the dice
Had to make our way through hell to get to paradise
Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no
We're the wicked and the wild 
Every night we come alive 
We're the wicked and the wild 
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild 
We are the children of the sky 
We're the wicked and the wild 
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
Fueled by desire tonight (

Hmm, hmm
I'm numb and I'm broken, my wounds are so close
And I'm trying to tie a knot where the bar is still open tonight, tonight
Put the cup to my lessons
, I speak without thinking
And it'll all disappear if I just keep on drinking tonight, tonight
Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else
Open my eyes and 
the sky is in mourning
A part of me died
, but a new day is turning in light, in light
Confusion and heartache, I'm back where I started
I'm back at thе bar once so dearly departеd last night, yeah

I must have died and gone to Heaven
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone

Fifteen then, and since then, I never look back home

I'm in the danger zone
Living in the madness, got no time for sadness
God, you're so loud
I couldn't hear my mouth
Living with the motion, no control
Just devotion
I won't ever stop 'til I touch the sky
Whoa, whoa
I won't stand alone 'til I win the fight

If we can't fight late, then we doublin' our fines
I'm gettin' money, but I'm doublin' my mind
When I was gettin' it, I would double up on the credit
But now a fool gonna want a bath with it
Do a song, have a joke, have a laugh with it
I ain't out here sayin' what it's gonna be
No way, 'cause I'm back where I wanna be
Heatwave will 
I'm mentally ill 
Life, it looks good, but it's fallin' uphill
You're gettin' greedy
When you forget the mil' 
Forget the pills, but remember bills
Fill this hole in this sky like a parachute
I had a rugged heart when I never hollowed you
So when I had another you
I was like "Oh, god, gotta work hard
Laugh when it's underused"
'Cause I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long
I've been on my own, I've been here alone
I've been on my own for too long

Me and my girls are about to go
Get our freaky, sexy on
On, on
You know I secured the bag
The good intentions never last
I’m about to spend my cash
Ah, ah
So let's just move to the beat now
Nothing you do could change my mood
Couple drinks down, my energy is out the roof
I like it, just trust and light the fuse
Hey, hey, hey

Make ya hot and I got you in a cold-sweat

I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do
There's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it
Try to forget about it

Pressure buildin', put that on me

Give me what I always wanted
Mirror, mirror, tell me something

The beat is heated up, the bass go boom
You been workin' double time to catch your breath
The tempo speeded up but don't stop yet
You need to, you need to exhale
So let everything go 
Baby, you in control
You need to, you need to exhale

Lights on, lights off, I'm still glowin'
Confidence I'm overflowin'
Voices tell me, "Keep your focus"

I've been a stranger in the most familiar place
Thought it was safer when I stood in the shade
Okay, well, here goes nothing
Might be the start of something
I’m steady, pickin' up the pace
Nothin' to lose, but I got the whole world to gain
This is the part where the bridge burns
This is the part where we turn and never look back
This is the point of no return, no return
Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain’t sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us undеr the lights
Eh, eh, eh, еh, eh, eh

Steady, pickin' up the pace
Look me in the eyes, tell me, who’s gonna stop us now?
This is the part where the bridge burns
This is the part where we turn and never look back
This is the point of no return, no return

Fill me up
So close I've got you face to face
Playing rough
Can't help it when you say my name
I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight

It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?

Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?

Possible Lyrics
I turn tables and speak too softly
I don't make much sense, I don’t make much sense
You're unable to calm down lightly
You're so intense, yeah you’re so intense
So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home
You and I, we're one too many worlds apart
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn't work but it does
And side by side, we're different but somehow the same
It really shouldn't work but it does
It really shouldn’t work but it does
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh oh
When it comes to us

Cigarettes and loneliness
I lost my way, haven't found it yet
An hour late, still undressed
I feel used, I'm confused, my life's such a mess
Who do I turn to when I'm in need?
Who is the person that's there for me?
Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?
My drink is warm, but I'm penniless
It doesn't show in the way I'm dressed
I'm nearing drunk and I lost my phone
Had enough of this club and I can't go home

Lying in my bed alone
No I never sleep
I'm only blaming me
Starring at the walls I know
All the pain they've seen
Don't pity me, no room for sympathy
Did this to myself
I lied to me
I'm nothing but a liability
I let me down
I cut me deep
I am my own worst enemy
I'm maybe broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Finding a reason to pick up the pieces
And build up what's left of me
I know I'm broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Tired of losing and making excuses
I'm building up what's left of me

I guess we're ready for the summer
I like us better when we're intertwined

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Missed my flight
Long gone, where is home?
No one knows
Excuse this life
I’ve chose full of cheap shots
The low blows
I never say, how I feel
No I never lie
No I never lie
But I rarely tell
Tell the truth
And you ask me why
And you ask me why
If I keep it real?
Honey will you feel me now?
Can I keep it real?
Tell me do you feel me now? 
Feel like I'm lost in translation
Tell me do you feel me now
Feel like I'm lost in translation

I've had a week from hell, I don't know how it started
Like a rollercoaster that never seems to end
Like a rain cloud above my shoulders
Oh, it feels like the weight is pouring down
Can anybody hear me, hear me, hear me now?
Can anybody see the path life chose somehow?
Can somebody just hold me in their arms tonight?
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
That girl at the party drinking alone
That girl at the party who just won't go home
Chasing boys, chasing dreams, so frustrated by reality
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be that girl at the party
I try my best, but I just can't get permission
Never could enough 'cause there's never a room for two
And sometimes my tears feel like a waterfall
But I guess to you, they don't mean a thing at all
Can anybody hear me, hear me, hear me now?
Can anybody see the path life chose somehow?
Can somebody just hold me in their arms tonight?

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy

Used to be afraid of love and what it might do

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no 
And this is what I should have ever said 
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in 

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

When I put my hands in the air
Look, look, I move like this
When I put my leg up back, forth, back
Look, look, I move like this
When I let my hips sink way, way, down
Look, look, I feel like this
When I flip my hair like up, down, to the middle
I'm a rockstar, just a little
Pay attention, grow up
I'm educatin'

True love one way or another

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

I've got a fever
Got a fever

Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?

Lyrics from Snippet
Sometimes you only find yourself
When you're losin’ someone else
So I owe it all to you

Call my name 
Call my name 
Call my name 
Call my name 
Call my name
Call my name
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I’m losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name

Woohoo
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride 
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life 
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like 
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me 
You might also like
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see it written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
No, we're never gonna be apart
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me 
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me 
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride 
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride 
Let's go!
Boy, I'm advanced, got my real tight pants
When I back it up, I put you in a trance 
If you wanna dance, then show me all your bands
'Cause tonight, I might give you a chance
 Pull up in the coupe
Ooh, that dude, he look hella cute
Yeah, he lookin' at me like "Ooh"
Suck my breasts like Betty Boop 
Oh my, my, my 
Get to stuttering like "I-I-I" 
I'm a freak, I like to play shy
But I will get it poppin', anything, I'll try it
Say I'm on his top five list
On a Major Key like Khaled
Don't speak, open up your eyelids
I can be your girl if you keep it private
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me 
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
Woohoo
I'm levitating 
Come on, come on, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I'm levitating 
Come on, come on, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating 

Ah
Ah, ah, ah
My darling, I was only 17
Thought I know what love was and what I need
Eyes starry, you were looking like a dream
Didn't move your lips but you spoke to me
I've been waiting a while to say I'm sorry cause
My heart's no longer a child
When I was on a high
And you were on a low
I wouldn't hesitate to pick you back up
And now, I'm in the deep
Can't give you what you need and
I love you too much to make you wait
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
I love you too much to make you wait

Wanna taste the danger on my tongue
Somethin’ wants to go wild
And yet I'm sorry but
My heart's no longer a child
When I was on a high
And you were on a low
I wouldn't hesitate to pick you back up
And now, I'm in the deep
Can't give you what you need and
I love you too much to make you wait
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
I love you too much to make you wait
Sorry that I have to go
When you know, you know, you know, you know
When you know, you know, you know, you know
You won't be sleeping alone
And I know, I know, I know, I know
It hurts me but I know, I know
Sorry that I have to go

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I

Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind

Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? 
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira

So look
There's a waste of time
Smoke inhale it all
Take the pain off my mind
I'm sorry bout the way that I've acted lately
I know you just care and you just wanna save me
Trying to enhance the performance of my mind
Taking advice from buried bombs
And this time I may be 
Out of line, I may be 
Out of time, oh my

That person is too inescapable
And I know that you had got some things to say
But maybe those things are debatable
So fade the lights to black

Sippin' with class

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
We're scared, we're scared
Scared to be lonely
We're scared, we're scared, we're scared to be lonely
We're scared, we're scared, we're scared to be lonely
We're scared, we're scared, we're scared to be lonely
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Am I running in the right direction? 
Can everything I want be mine? 
Is this a hard day for perfection? 
Am I gonna get it right?
It feels like a breathe
But I'm scared of no one but myself
I'm falling, have I failed?
Is this my cry for help?
I feel it coming
But I'll stand my ground
Find a heaven
When my heart's held bound
Hold my head up
As the tears pour down
I'm not running
I'm gonna stand my ground
Being in love's incarceration 
Being alone just passes time 
Is this a wasted education 
Am I destined for a life of crime?

Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit
Mon cœur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix
Le plus souvent, c'est quand je pense à toi

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

I got you
Moonlight
You're my
Starlight
I need you
All night
Come on dance with me
Come on dance with me
I'm levitating
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

I'm one of the greatest, ain't no debatin' on it
I'm still levitated, I'm heavily medicated
Ironic I gave 'em love and they end up hatin' on me
She told me she love me and she been waitin'
Been fightin' hard for your love and I'm runnin' thin on my patience
Needed someone to hug, even took it back to the basics
You see what you got me out here doin'?
Mighta threw me off, but can't nobody stop the movement
Uh-uh, let's go
Left foot, right foot, levitatin'
Pop star, Dua Lipa with DaBaby
I had to lace my shoes for all the blessings I was chasin'
If I ever slip, I'll fall into a better situation
So catch up, go put some cheese on it
Get out and get your bread up
They always leave when you fall, but you run together
Weight of the world on my shoulders, I kept my head up
So baby, stand up, 'cause, girl, you
You want me , I want you, baby 
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

It's never gonna wash away
Are we sinners or are we saviours?
Regret the day I heard your name
And your array of bad behaviour
If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could
But I'm hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over 
Irreversible, it's over 
Once it starts, it never stops
I need you here to feed my craving
But maybe we should separate
Go different ways
We both need saving

Untie the knots in my heart-strings
Let me go
Untie the ropes, let my heart see
Irreversible
Yeah, you're deep, you're deep under my skin
Let me go
I'm weak when you leave, my demon

Late nights, loneliness
Tell me why I'm here again
Maybe I don't wanna know the truth
Green eyes, golden lips
Seal the poison with a kiss
I guess there's no remedy for you
I can resist everything but temptation
Honestly, I can do anything
But keep you waiting
I know that you're bad for me
But we keep on happening
Something deep and down in me
Keeps on saying, "Uh-huh"
Protect me from what I want
And all I want is you
Protect me from what I want
There's nothing I can do
Protect me from what I want
And all I want is you, you, you-ou
Own worst influence
You look like my favourite fix
No onе else to blame for this but mе
Don't analyze this, don't sympathize
'Cause I know exactly what I like
And I'll do it twice, and then some

Rich Lyrics
Spend so much time and so much energy
And I didn't have anymore left for me
The best things in life should always come for free
'Cause you can't buy love with an apology
I ran on empty for a minute
But then I met you
Now I'm livin' with no limits
You got me chasin' feelings
I never knew I needed
My heart was broke
But now I feel rich again
Thought that the night was over
That's when you pull me closer
My heart was broke
But now I feel rich again

You got me seein' things with a new attitude
I ran on empty for a minute
But then I met you
Now I'm livin' with no limits
You got me chasin' feelings
I never knew I needed
My heart was broke
But now I feel rich again
Thought that the night was over
That's when you pull me closer
My heart was broke
But now I feel rich again

We doin' good
We doin' good
That's your problem
Pulling me down like an anchor
Sayin' it's my fault, you're angered
Telling me no one will love me 
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
You and me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that 
Now it's my turn to bite back 
Ooh, did it to yourself 
Playing with my mind 
Putting me through hell 
Ooh, I'd be broken too 
If you left me like  like I left you
That's your problem
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues 
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues

I mean you act like I did it for that long
I couldn't even do it that long
That's your problem
Doin' it all for reaction
Doing the most in your caption
Making me seem like the bad guy 
Try to bring me down, but nice try
I used to like you
How did I like you? 
I used to like you
And now I don't 
Ooh, I'd be broken too 
If you left me like  like I left you
That's your problem
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues 
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues 
And my daddy said you're good for nothing 
Cause he know you're always up to something 
And my friends, they don't wanna hear about it anymore, anymore
I'm just happy that you're not my problem 
All you wanna talk about girls, hoes, chicks, this and that
Wanna be Mr. Instagram famous, comment, DMing
That's your problem
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues 
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem

Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to, and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish
Don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Hmm
Oh-oh-oh here, here
Hmm
Here, here

Good in Bed  Lyrics
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
You might also like
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
Yeah, we don't know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu—
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad

It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, thе kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, thе kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

In my party dress, damn I'm such a mess
I can't handle this, I'm going home
Did my hair real nice, but can barely smile
You didn't show up tonight, so what's the point
My friends are begging me to stay out
I'm done with being your playground
Got me putting on a brave face
But inside I really hate it
I can't believe you didn't show up
Kinda makes me wanna throw up
Feel like I'm about to blow up
For the very last time 
I know it's a celebration but I just wanna cry
No matter how much I keep dancing
My tears won't seem to dry
I know it's a celebration but I just wanna cry
Gonna get you out of my system
This is my last goodbye
I'm sick of you, I'm fed up

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely-ly-ly-ly?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Scared to be lonely-ly
To be lo-o-o-nely-ly

I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out

One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
One of many
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
I don't pretend, and I won't sit still, gonna show ya
That kind of woman 
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to mе
I want you to myself
No, I won't be, won't be onе
Won't be one, one of many

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause we're hot like hell

Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each othеr mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Pleasе, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when you're going down, I get so up 
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay

It's like an addiction

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby

If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home

But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Don’t Start Now  Lyrics
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survivе you
I'm better on the othеr side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on

Hands on each other

Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Yeah, yeah
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

All my lies are wearin' thin

Love me up, I come undone
See the darkness I've become

I wanna scream a little higher

Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red

Hiding all my real feelings

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me

You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

But diamond lies, tears are temporary 
I know what it's like, seduction makes you blind
Open up your eyes and focus on the light
Getting rich doesn't stop us getting old
Money money, isn't it so funny
I'll give you what you want

Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold еach other, use each othеr, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes

Have you ever lost the feeling in your fingers
Like a co-cold night?
When you gotta break a heart, apart
You can't be too polite
Feel the heaviness, pushing on your chest
When you're in an argument so tense
It gets you paralysed
Anxiety
Takin' over me
Feel it coming on again
Feel it creepin' on my skin
Tell me how you deal it under, under
Tell me how you feel it under, under
Have you ever failed to find the words
When you need them the most? (
Exactly

Or are you feelin' watched around the clock
Under a microscope?

Instead of lovin' your own

Hey, hey
After a few drinks, I start thinking about what we had
It gets complicated in my head
In my bed, in my

It's like I'm not there
And I just want you to know

And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it

We are runaways, so we misbehave
And your mama warned you to stay away
I don't wanna leave your humanity
But we were fallin' in water and then we found the sea
There's just two of us, and it's true of me
And the lost by the society
Had to sacrifice, had to roll the dice
Had to make our way through hell to get to paradise

Not with us or against us, no, no, no

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

Intro: Ant Clemons]
Wait a minute, uh
You came to me without warnin’
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwin’ up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
Act of God, don’t know how it started
Now I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

And the ways we move

Got me lifted 
Act of God 
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire 
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m startin’ to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine 
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused 
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you

Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh
I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

Lyrics from Snippet
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”, if you ain't runnin’ game
Say my name, say my name, actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin’ me "baby", why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”, if you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
Better say my name
Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

New love, new love
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah

Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love

Fuck the lonely outta me
Until I forget to breathe
Take me to the happy place

Dua, Dua
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you

If I was gonna choose the one for me
He'd naturally be cool but not know it
At least six feet of height, and easy on the eyes
My friends would think he's nice, 'cause he shows it
I was so caught up in all the wrong guys
Didn't know I could find love in my mind
Snips & snails & puppy dog tales
Never forget the little details
Make-believe, but I'll be alright
Me and my flawless Frankenstein
Woah, oh
You're so picture perfect, eyes closed
I made myself a lover out of gold
You are my creation in my imagination
You won't see me crying no more
When I'm dancing with a ghost, ghost, ghost
When I'm dancing with a ghost, ghost, ghost
When I'm dancing with a ghost, ghost, ghost
When I'm dancing with a ghost
My diamond in the rough, I would flaunt it
Manipulate his touch, how I wanted
He would get it right, hit it every time
Better than real life, if I'm honest

... first time, say yeah yeah yeah
You were trouble from the very first time
First time, say yeah yeah
Baby go on with your bad self

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la

I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again

Can you play “Physical” for me?
Of course I can
Common love isn't for us
We created somethin' phenomenal
Don't you agree?

You got me feelin' diamond rich
Nothin' on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on

Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancin' like you ain't got a choice

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

Hanging on minutes

This is religious, my body's speaking in tongues
I won't forget this, it feels good, it's too good

When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
Cold, cold heart
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no

Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now 
Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now
Heavy like the bass-line
Way past “Good Girl” bed time
Had too much, drunk as fuck
Swaying to those red lights
On my worst behavior
Makin’ out with strangers
Dusty buzz, feel the rush
Speedin’ through my head

Uh oh, uh oh
Every night I go
Every night I go sneaking out the door
I lie a little more, baby, I'm helpless
There's something 'bout the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me
What would my mama do
If she knew 'bout me and you?
What would my daddy say
If he saw me hurt this way?
Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Here we are again
It's nearly perfect

Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family

Fuck all these rumours in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air
Fuck all these rumours in the-

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then why are we wasting time?
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't mess this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

If you need your space then I won't hold you back
And I just don't know what you're lookin' for
But good luck, good luck, good luck
Good luck tryna find somethin' like us
I'm not that worried, I trust

You gon' be missing my love
And when nobody's enough
Can't be the one that you need

Lyrics from Snippet
...keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we don't freak out
We hide our figures-
-tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?

For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

And you say I'm crazy

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in

Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning

Hard liquor, playing games
Just say my name, I wanna see you later
Pour me one, 'cause he fooled me twice
Push me down, I know I'm no better
I'm not here for ya, not here for ya
Not here for ya, no, no, no, no
Huh, who do you think you are?
I've heard it all before, just let this bass-line roll
Who, just me and you?
I'll wait for tonight, while the strobe-lights so bright

Mm, mm
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease

Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Somethin’ in you-ou-ou lit up Heaven in me-e-e
The feelin’ won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
[Chorus: 
Shawn Mendes
, Dua lipa]
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
There's nothing holdin' me back
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
I'm all good already, so moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
[Chorus: Dua Lipa & 
Shawn Mendes
]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
There's nothing holdin' me back
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

...
I got a couple of habits that I'm not proud of
The second I'm close to somebody I fall out of love
But you're way to good so I don't wanna mess you

Lying in my bed alone
No I never sleep
I'm only blaming me
Starring at the walls I know
All the pain they've seen
Don't pity me, no room for sympathy
Did this to myself
I lied to me
I'm nothing but a liability
I let me down
I cut me deep
I am my own worst enemy
I'm maybe broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Finding a reason to pick up the pieces
And build up what's left of me
I know I'm broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Tired of losing and making excuses
I'm building up what's left of me
You might also like
Room is filling up with doubt
Caving in between floor and ceilling
Open from the inside out
Something no one sees
I bruise and bleed
Did this to myself
I lied to me
I'm nothing but a liability
I let me down
I cut me deep
I am my own worst enemy
I'm maybe broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Finding a reason to pick up the pieces
And build up what's left of me
I know I'm broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Tired of losing and making excuses
I'm building up what's left of me
Just me figuring out myself
Trying to grow Ain't I, ain't i?
Just me don't wanna drown
Myself trying to float
Ain't I, ain't I?
I'm maybe broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Finding a reason to pick up the pieces
And build up what's left of me
I know I'm broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Tired of losing and making excuses
I'm building up what's left of me
I'm maybe broken
But I'm still holding on to me
Finding a reason to pick up the pieces

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, when you go
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had

Cold, cold heart
And this is what I should have ever said
Though, I thought it, but I kept it in
Cold, cold heart
Cold, cold heart
Dua Lipa
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
’Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in
Cold, cold heart
Dua Lipa
And I think it’s gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no

We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good, good, good
That's never gonna change
Never gonna change
We're not meant to
We're not meant to be
We'rе not meant to be, that's nevеr gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good, good, good
That's never gonna change
Never gonna change

Are you
Someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
Play fair
Is that a compass in your nature?
Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there?
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice
But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Convеrsation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
Arе you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
You might also like
I tried
To see my lovers in a good light
Don't wanna do it just to be nice
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right
I hope
It hits me like an arrow
Someone with some potential
Is it too much to ask for?
Who understands I
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
Can you compete? Now is your time
Run when you hear that whistle blow
Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines
Waiting for someone to tell you to go?
For someone to tell you to go
You should know I
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul 
Conversation overload
'Cause training season's over
'Cause training season's over



Hi
Mm, mm
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
You might also like

Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

This last song is my last song and it's called "Hotter Than Hell"
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

You ain't gonna walk free, boy
Not finished with you yet, no
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah

I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
Catch me or I go Houdini
Catch me or I go Houdini
Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
You might also like
If you're good enough, you'll find the way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change 
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay
Houdini
Catch me or I go Houdini
Catch me or I go Houdini
Everything you say is soundin' so sweet 
But do you practice everythin' that you preach? 
I need something that'll make me believe 
If you got it, baby, give it to me
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go 
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows

Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes

You can see my heartbeat tonight
I can take the heat, baby, best believe
That's the moment I shine
'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me dance, dance the night away
My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dancе, dance the night away 
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

Still be lookin' my best

I ain't missin' no steps
