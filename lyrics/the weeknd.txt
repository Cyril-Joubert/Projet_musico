The Hills Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
You might also like
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies 
Only you to trust, only you
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine

Starboy Lyrics
Ayy
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah

I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

Can’t Feel My Face Lyrics
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me

And stay forever young
This I know, uh

Die For You Lyrics
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah 
You might also like
I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you, uh
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone

Reminder Lyrics
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein 
You know me (Know me, uh, 
na-na-na-na-na
)
You know me (Know me, know me, 
oh-oh-oh
)
You know me (Know me, know me, 
na-na-na-na-na

Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape,
 
sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies
, 
roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you
'Cause you know me 
You know me (Know me, ah, 
na-na-na-na-na
)
You know me (Know me, know me, 
oh-oh-oh

Every time you try to forget who I am 
I'll be right there to remind you again

Why don't you shake somethin', shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin', work somethin'

For the Don? Don't you break nothin' , break nothin'

Call Out My Name Lyrics
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? 
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You might also like
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough

So call out my name when I kiss you so gently 
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name 
Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way
And, I'll be on my—
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way

Blinding Lights Lyrics
Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

I could never say it on the phone 
Will never let you go this time 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights

Hey, hey, hey

Heartless Lyrics
Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro 
Ayy

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need 
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target

We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step

I'm fallin' in too deep 
Without you, I can't sleep 
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you 
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no

Save Your Tears Lyrics

Intro

Ooh
Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room 
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day 
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said 
Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day

Sidewalks Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs

Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head 
Head, head, more head 
Oh God, bless the dead 
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from
Sidewalks saved my life 
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life

But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on

Hurricane Lyrics
See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless
, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons talk on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

Wasted Times Lyrics
Wasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself
And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' 
But you've been with me from the beginnin' 
And I know right now that we're not talkin' 
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up 
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion 
This sex will get you high without no other substance

Tell Your Friends Lyrics
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it

Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches 
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute 
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz

Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it

And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone

The Morning Lyrics
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping

Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets

Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money

In the Night Lyrics
All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And I know 
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when 
You wake up, she's always gone, gone, gone, oh
In the night, she hears him calling
In the night, she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night, when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

She was young and she was forced to be a woman

I don't think you understand
Oh, baby
I don't think you understand 
I don't think you understand 
I don't think you understand
Oh, no, no, no
I don't think you understand 
In the night, she hears him calling 
In the night, she's dancin' to relieve the pain 
She'll never walk away 
I don't think you understand 
In the night, when she comes crawlin' 
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face 
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

King of the Fall Lyrics
I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
 
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin' 
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher 
Only time you see me's when I'm 
balling with
 
my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private 
My flight too private
, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like 
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like
You might also like
Don't be mad, let her get hers 
Don't be mad, let her get hers 
She made her own luck, 
she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun
, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her 
Your girl so bad, let me get her 
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me 
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin'
 
I've been out here last year wasting hella time 
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday 
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace 
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday 
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it 
Baby girl, you know what I like 
Baby, you know just what I like 
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like, mm
I just passed that "Nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow,  all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow,  all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow,  all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow
All of them swallow,  all of them swallow

I don't want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow

So let me keep my eyes closed

Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah

In Your Eyes Lyrics
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
You might also like
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it 
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind

When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know 
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you

Pray For Me Lyrics
I'm always ready for a war again 
Go down that road again 
It's all the same 
I'm always ready to take a life again 
You know I'll ride again 
It's all the same 
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today, I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? 
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? 
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be
You might also like
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own

Kiss Land Lyrics
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back
You might also like
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh yeah, don’t hold back, let it out
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back, let it out
Oh yeah, don’t hold back
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried

Acquainted Lyrics
Baby, you're no good
'Cause they warned me 'bout your type, girl, I've been ducking left and right
Baby, you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feelin' this way
You probably think I'm lyin', lyin'
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

All my niggas think I'm crazy 'cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real , yeah
'Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me , sh-yeah
But ever since I met you 
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me, babe, ain't no rush from me, babe
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body 
I got you touchin' on your body 
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted
I'm not tryna talk at all
'Cause I'm tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink 'til you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although, they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous

Uh, oh, ayy, yeah, yeah
Been on another level since you came, no more pain
You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay

But, baby, it's okay, them my niggas next door
And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me, girl, 'cause you wanted to have fun

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

The Party & The After Party Lyrics
I understand, your body wants it
I know your thoughts, oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl, and it's your world
And I'ma let you do it how you 
Ride with it, ride with it
I know you know, I know you wanna ride with it
Don't be shy with it, I'll supply with it
I got you, girl, oh, I got it, girl
With your Louis V. bag, tats on your arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink, baby, don't you fall
Be there in a minute, baby, just one call
You don't gotta ask me

Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Should have fucking rolled, but I fucking pulled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your loving
I need more
I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sitting on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sipping on this, baby, living off bliss
Got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feeling I would give to
You
Oh, you

Oh, I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me, with me
I, I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma please stop calling
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeling I would give to
You
Oh, you

Oh, I got it, girl
Well, I got it, girl

Six Feet Under Lyrics
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase 
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money, she play no games
She lick it up just like a candy 
She wanna make 'em leave they family

She wanna pull up in a Bentley 
She ain't got time for lovin'

Rolling Stone Lyrics
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long
'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades

Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen
But until then
Baby, I got you, ooh

Privilege Lyrics
Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, let's just try to end it with a smile
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh
I don't wanna hear that no more, no more
No more, no more
I don't wanna hear that no more

Twenty Eight Lyrics
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate 
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep

But who keeps calling on your phone?
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep

Escape From LA Lyrics
You pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us
They buy you bags and jewelry, yeah
They think your kindness is so weak
No, you don't give it up so easy, baby
But you just wanted my attention
You just wanted my affection
You got me tattooed on your mind
You just want me all the time
We'll figure out our shit and find a way 
When you say that you need space, I give you space 
Girl, when you're ready, you know where I stay
When it comes to all these hoes, I'll never chase
But this world is such a, such an evil place
Man, these hoes will always find a way
'Cause when I'm on the liquor, I go crazy
And for that pussy, you know I'm a slave, yeah
Well, this place is never what it seems

Got everything I wanted

Snowchild Lyrics
I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving

Leaving into the night, oh
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin'
 and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

Loft Music Lyrics
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh , oh 
Oh, oh
They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em is
I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So, baby, take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fuckin' seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man

You like them keys? We gon' play all day 
Wet dream fry your brain all day, all day

After rollin' through the city with me
I promise you gon' see

Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doin' in the bathroom? 
I hear noises in the bathroom 
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah, we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah, we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, mothafucka, I'm raw
My love so lost, and my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah, I got 'em
'Til the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie, filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls

She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down, you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you thirsty
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that back 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

Drunk In Love  Lyrics
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on,
 
bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty,
 niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it,
 
droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, 
I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night

Hurt You Lyrics
And now I know relationship's my enemy
So stay away from me
I'm warning you
You try to fill the void with every man you meet
'Cause you're upset with me
I'm warning you
'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight
I don't wanna hurt you 
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you 
I don't wanna hurt you
When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me
Just call me up again

Not between your heart
Can't you see?

Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray

With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up , in the back of a flashing car 

Prisoner Lyrics
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly 
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say  that I would be nothing without your love 
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place , yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

False Alarm Lyrics
Bathroom stalls for the powder nose 
High heel shoes with the open toes 
She's got a good time wrapped in gold  
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes 
So obsessed with the camera lights 
You love her, but you can't deny 
The truth, the truth
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm
False alarm 
False alarm

Dark Times Lyrics
Waking up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well, baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why
In my dark time, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time
Light one up, let me bum a smoke, uh
Still coming down, dripping throat, uh
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & 
The Weeknd

In my dark times, I've still got some problems, I know
Drivin' too fast but just movin' too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pullin' me back every time
[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & 
The Weeknd
]
In my dark times, taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time, taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time

The Hills  Lyrics
Said you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still, if he knew I was here, he'd wanna kill me
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung 
Like an ejector seat from an F-15
But tonight, we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see 
That...
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
You might also like
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't you know 
Remember when I told you 
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you 
Feel like dirt when I hold you 
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you'll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him
Just means I will be the next to be your ex
So no complexities, just sex
And don't lecture me, just accept that...
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Alone Again Lyrics
Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone 
In Vegas, I feel so at home 
I'm falling only for the night
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky 
Oh, oh, oh, how much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh, baby, won't you remind me what I am
And break, break my little cold heart?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can be alone again 
I don't know if I can sleep alone again 
Check my pulse for a second time 
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again 
I don't know if I can sleep alone again

Real Life Lyrics
Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for lovin', uh
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin', uh
It's all I know, never learned much more

That's real life, oh, oh-oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh, oh-oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
I know you don't really understand it, uh

Die For You  Lyrics
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love

XO / The Host Lyrics
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patrón
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more, lost your C notes
Cabbed all day, took the bus back home
Evictions on your door, blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, 'cause I get it
You're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin'
'Specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke
You need more bread, ‎now you got no rent
You blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day
Hipster nights downtown and your daddy don't know you're out
If they don't let you in
You know where to find me
'Cause if you wanna go again
You can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up your mind, you can find the love

'Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV?
Why? I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess
You look so depressed
And you're filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home, oh
'Cause these nights pass, so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up, you need money for ya' face lift
Lust over love is your mindset
Waken up with most of your side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
'Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party
If they won't let you in
You know where to find me, oh
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up your mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone

Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
And girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far
Well, I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I
Need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out

Echoes of Silence Lyrics
Talk to me, baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up?
Girl, I saw it in your eyes
And, baby, I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone
Would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected
Girl, you're such a masochist
And I ask why
And you reply
I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So, baby, don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby, please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little lie

Valerie Lyrics
There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
And there are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say
Like I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation 
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
Valerie 
I know you can see through me
Valerie 
You just choose to never know
Valerie
Why pretend to trust in me?

Scared To Live Lyrics
When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go 
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close 
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else 
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left 
They just made you feel lonely 
I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart

So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again

I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
I said don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start

And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

Lost in the Fire Lyrics
I wanna fuck you slow with the lights on 
You're the only one I've got my sights on 
Type of sex you could never put a price on 
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on 
And I just want a baby with the right one
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one
And we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe

I used to have a girl a day 
But I want you to stay 
You said you might be into girls 
Said you're going through a phase 
Keeping your heart safe 
Well, baby, you can bring a friend 
She can ride on top your face 
While I fuck you straight 
You might also like
And we lost a lot of things in the fire 
So it took a year for me to find out 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
I'm tired of being home alone
Used to have a girl a day 
But I want you to stay 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh 
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
I can't lose you, babe 
Oh-oh

You Right Lyrics
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
And you're right
You right, I
Got my guy
But I, I
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I
Got my guy
But I, I
Can't help it, I want you
I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairytales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Oh, you could take it out on me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to bе
I can't tell no one, but they all know

Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy 
When you're on top of me 
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate 
'Cause you choose loyalty 
And I know your history 
Met him before your peak 
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me

The Birds Pt. 2 Lyrics
Whoa, with a nigga like me
Whoa, with a nigga like me
She said please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her
She begged me, she gave me all her pills
Now my back hurts, she lost control
Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long before she falls out of love

Live For Lyrics
Getting sober for a day got me feeling too low 
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live, I'm about to lose control 
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night
I'm in my city in the summer, camo'd out, leather booted
, 
kissing bitches in the club
They wanna threesome , then some 
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it gets you
Living dreams we can never afford
Now, we sitting in the back, sayin'
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
Yeah
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall?
That's a serious question, 'cause I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world, man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall, dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, 
still scream, "XO!" when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for?
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know, I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean, for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working

Drink it till I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims
Baby girl, I gotcha

Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'ma give you what you fiend, oh
But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar
By the way I fuckin' hid it
And you'll never fuckin' know
I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Dirty Sprite toastin'
Fast life, fuck slow
Low life for life
Let the meds flow, let the night flow
I'm so gone, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Woah, woah, oh
Said I'm gone, gone, gone
Woah oh

Love Me Harder Lyrics
Tell me somethin' I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Somethin' bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder

If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

Adaptation Lyrics
When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
You might also like
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

Professional Lyrics
It's ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional
You might also like
What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb?
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day, you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's s'posed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl, I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional
We're professional

Ordinary Life Lyrics
Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers lettin' go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum 
She just givin' head, she don't know what I done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young 
Die when I'm young , die when I'm young
Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
Yeah, she said that she'll pray for me
I said it's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life

Do a buck twenty, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

Same Old Song Lyrics
Where were you when I needed you eight months ago?
All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringing up my phone
I bet you miss me now, baby, I bet you'd kiss me now, baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential couldn't ever last this long
Well, baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right?
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song
And now I'm poppin', yeah
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin', yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you, girl, ooh
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well, you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club

You never thought that I would ever go this far

Belong To the World Lyrics
The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well
You might also like
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby
I'm not a fool 
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool,  I'm just lifeless too 
But you taught me how to feel 
When nobody ever would 
And you taught me how to love 
When nobody ever could 
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
And learn to mistreat you 
'Cause you belong to the world 
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you 
Domesticate you 
But you belong to the world 
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world

​off the table Lyrics
Will I ever love the same way again? (
Way again
)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (
Next life
)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (
Too steady
)
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
Will you be thеre? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Verse 2: The Weeknd, 
Ariana Grande
 & 
Both
]
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (
You can see right through it
)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to 
someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

Pretty Lyrics
Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa, oh-oh
'Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been livin' on the road
And you've been livin' all alone at home
Girl, I hope, he made you satisfied 
Well, baby, I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman, woah
I try to master the art of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been livin' in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
You might also like
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful

And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveau
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans

Coming Down Lyrics
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
I got something to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl, I been bad again, girl, I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down 
I always want you when I'm coming down 
I always want you when I'm coming down

Enemy Lyrics
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So back, I'm so bad, I'm so bad
Can I be honest with you, please?
It's really hard for me to speak right now
Girl, I been drinkin' all day
It's been a long week, can't you tell by my face?
I wanna lose myself between your legs
I wanna make your body shake
Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase
I promise you'll have nothing to say, nothing to say
'Cause the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word
And I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to get you high without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word

You can help me out baby
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have
So I don't know what to expect from you tonight
But I'm not trying to waste nobody's time
I'm just trying to find material, some inspiration
We can put it in a song, if you want
But the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be, oh yeah
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word
And I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
And I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
And I'm just trying to get you high without a word
And I'm just trying to make you numb without a word

Girl, I'm just trying to let you leave without a word
Without a word
Please, please, please
Ooh, let me, let me, let me
Let me, get what I want this time
I'll never fall for a girl like you
I'll never understand what you're going through
But your body wild and your head game too
You lookin' at my nigga, you can have him too
'Cause baby, I ain't cuffing, girl, I hope you knew
There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "What did I do?"
Girl, you know what you did, all to blame is you
Now the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be

All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well, babygirl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
Fuck it, I popped one
I popped one
Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?

The Fall Lyrics
You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall

I've felt the ground before

But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "Who's next? Who's next?"
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before

Love In The Sky Lyrics
There's no one inside
But you're free to relax
If you commit to this ride
There's no turning back
You've been here before
Remember these sheets?
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
I could teach you to dream, oooh

How does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel, are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Control, control, control

Girl, I’m open to anything that'll get you into that zone
And understand that we’re all alone

Baby girl, you know what's in store
And baby I will stay up all night
I've been goin' hard since last night
And I'ma go harder tonight
Wish you could see you through my eyes
Ooh, I'm telling you this ain't the same
And I know he's still in your brain
I'm 'bout to burn that shit into flames
Once I'm in you, baby
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
'Cause baby when I'm finished with ya
You won't wanna go outside
And I'ma work you like a pro, baby
Why, and you gon' take it like one

And I'ma give it like you asked for it

Ooh, baby, when I'm done with you, why

Ooh, baby, when I'm done with you, why
You ain't saying nothing

All the pain that you feel you can tell

But I'll pretend, oh girl, I'll pretend

Out of Time Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time 
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time

And I remember when I held you

Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time 
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time 
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time

Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time 
Out of time (
Pretend—
)
Out of time (
Pretend—
)
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks

Hawái  Lyrics
"]
Yeah
So now he's your heaven 
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous 
You put on such an act when you're sleepin' together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage 
I don't want marriage 
I'd rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary 
And at least we'll share something that's real 
I can tell that you're just tryna feel

Moth to a Flame Lyrics
Oh-woah
Woah-oh-oh
Woah
Like a moth to a flame
I'll pull you in, I pulled you back to
What you need initially
It's just one call away
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
But this time, I let you be
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true
But does he know you call me when he sleeps?
But does he know the pictures that you keep?
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies

Yeah
You should be with him, I let you go from time
You should stay with him

His love for you is true 
But does he know you call me when he sleeps? 
But does he know the pictures that you keep? 
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies
Right here with me, babe
Where it truly lies
My bed, babe
Where it truly lies
In my arms, babe
Where it truly lies
Where it truly lies
Where it truly lies
Where it truly lies

Nothing Without You Lyrics
I realized I belong to you
I feel the darkness when away from you, hey yeah
Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
)
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
)
Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it? Woah-woah
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no, I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past

D.D. Lyrics
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no, oh no
You'll never make me stay so take your head off of me
I know your every move, so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me...
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin' me so to start...
She say, "There's no turnin' back," she trapped me in her heart!
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no...!
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
  
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt

I'll be your everything if you make me a star."
Dirty Diana, no

She said, "I have to go home ‘cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone sayin', "Baby I'm alright."
I said, "Unlock the door cause I forgot the key!"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me!"
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

One Of The Girls Lyrics
Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta bе in love, no
I don't gotta be the onе, no

We don't gotta be in love, no

Till Dawn  Lyrics
I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I'll just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You might also like
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
I’ll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won’t stop until you ask me
Don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
And know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

Is There Someone Else? Lyrics
I know that you're hiding something from me
That's been close to your heart
And I felt it creepin' up every day
Baby, right from the start
I know that look you give when we're fighting 
We're fighting 
'Cause I used to be the one who was lying 
Oh, lying 
Oh, is there someone else or not?
'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause I need to know
If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
Is there someone else or not?
Ooh, or not?
I don't deservе someone loyal to me
Don't you think I see?
And I don't want to bе a prisoner to who I used to be
I swear I changed my ways for the better, the better
'Cause I wanna be with you forever, forever

Oh, is there someone else or not?

Tears In The Rain Lyrics
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain 
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch
You might also like
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain 
So now that she's gone 
Embrace all that comes 
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become 
They all feel the same
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh, yeah
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
They all feel the same 
Adjust to the fame 
'Cause no one will love you like her 
It's pointless 
Like tears in the rain 
So now that she's gone 
Embrace all that comes 
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become 
They all feel the same 
Adjust to the fame 
'Cause no one will love you like her 
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain 
So now that she's gone

Gasoline Lyrics
It's 5 AM my time again
I've soakin' up the moon, can't sleep
It's 5 AM my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushin' myself further
I'm just tryin' to feel my heartbeat beat 
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's 5 AM, I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain 
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm lookin' at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M
.
I'm trying not to lose my faith
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in these sheets 
And pour out the gasolinе
It don't mean much to me

Make me believe there's more to live
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me 
I know you won't let me OD 
And if I finally die in peace 
Just wrap my body in these sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me

Said you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on 
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
I got one comin' over and one right now 
One right now
(
One right now, one right now, oh

I got one comin' over and one right now
Said you wanna have my babies
I fucked you so good, you should pay me
Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong
But I got over what you did already
Body for a body, I’m so petty
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? 
Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby
Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby
Truth is, maybe one's just not еnough

The Town Lyrics
You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne
You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne
I haven't been around my town in a long while
I apologize, but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
On me
But I remember on the bathroom floor
'Fore I went on tour
Like you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, oooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And uh huh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will

Honey, please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in 
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in
We
Who?
Oooh...
Oooooooh...
No ho...
Let her know...
You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne

Take My Breath Lyrics
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try 
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe 
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—
Want me to hold on to you tight
You pull me closer, feel the heat between your thighs 
You're way too young to end your life

I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
What you do, what you do, what you do
Gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Super star undercover
You're my number one fan
Give it to me right
Watch the diamond glow your hand
Get you wetter than reverb, right after the dessert
Baby you're my Dairy Queen
Watch you make my baby cream
Lady, you're the one that I want to spend my cash on
Spend my cash on my baby like

Nothing Compares Lyrics
I been tryin' hard to find the words to say 
If we tried again, we'd make the same mistakes 
Asphyxiated 
I'll never make it 
Without my baby, oh-ooh-oh
So I fill the void, I know you do the same
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
Nothing compares to the emptiness we both share 
And nobody cares like you do 
You asked for my heart, but I didn't know where to start 
But they won't think of you like I do 
I try my best to not get high again 
But I've been stuck inside this place for days on end 
Intoxicated 
I'll never make it 
Without my baby, oh-ooh-oh
So I fill the void just like I did back then
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

Here We Go... Again Lyrics
Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebratin' Super Bowl
Catalog lookin' legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again
You might also like
Ooh

But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

To go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step, you're the life of the party
Know that step, you're the life of the party

How Do I Make You Love Me? Lyrics
We're goin' back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? 
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me 
And make it last eternally?

I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again
Like embers of a fire
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said
How do I make you love me? 
How do I make you fall for me? 
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? 
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me 
And make it last eterna

The Hills  Lyrics
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Remember that time I showed up
With just panties under my coat?
High heels, they was knee high
And my legs was grippin' that throat
You told me this and I quote
'Cause we popped pills and you smoked
You said, "Your stuff got me strung out
It's like doin' lines of some coke"
You always say it's the best
That you ever had in your life
And you always play with it good
When we be speedin' off in that Wraith
Just keep coppin' them things
That you be coppin' me on the eighth
You the president and I'm Biden
Just slide in cause you safe, nigga, third base
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
You might also like
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple

Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Power Is Power Lyrics
I was born of the ice and snow
With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes
Heavy is the crown only for the weak
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down
I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless

Love to Lay Lyrics
It has begun again, my friend
In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?
Well, I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy 
'Cause she loves to lay (
Woah
)
I learned the hard way (
Oh
)
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way (
Oh
)
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way 
It has begun again, my friend 
In your heart, we are  nothing but strangers in the end
Then I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy

He's just one call away
From your mind and your heart

Don't say those words that you'll regret
Baby girl, I can tell that you think that I'm right for you
I already know that it's not true, but girl, I'll lie to you

Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin'

Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'?
Models and bottles with us, ain't nothin' to it
I tell you, "I got you," that's well understood
Your legs on the bed, got your head on the floor
We go out shoppin' whenever we get bored
We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store
If I go to Saturn, I know that you goin'
Fuck me on Saturday, early in the mornin'
Flyer than a bird, she gon' open her door
Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse
Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support
Stars in the ceilin', don't feel like a Porsche
Came from the trenches, just livin' at war
Once was a prostitute, I can afford you

Missed You Lyrics
Convinced myself to run around with someone else to forget about you
But I can't hold you responsible for the things I do
I said your name by mistake, played it off like I'm just confused
But I was frontin', lyin' to myself when I know the truth
Was I missed you
Yes, it's true
I should've known not to let you go, let you go
'Cause I missed you
Baby boo
We could've grown if I held you close, held you close
I hurt myself a hundred times just to feel something in my soul
I kept knocking even though I knew what's behind that door
But then I heard you call my name and it sounded like the sweetest song
You never moved on, you were waiting for me all along
Well, I missed you
Yes, it's true
I should've known not to let you go, let you go
Well, I missed you

Phantom Regret by Jim Lyrics
You're tuned to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here a while
Now that all future plans have been postponed
And it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering, no nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
When the purple rain falls, we're all bathed in its grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when you're not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right
They just open their petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close? 
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment, we don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos, but He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind, train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo

In other words
You gotta be Heaven to see Heaven
May peace be with you

In Your Eyes  Lyrics
[Intro: Doja Cat &

Oh
Ooh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark, and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way

Love the way you're talkin', love your style, but, ooh, babe
We know that you got it from me
And it's haunting you deep, too hard not to see it
Hate the way I feel love, only hurts with real love
And it's taking every part of me, when you look, I could see love
One day, I'm giving you space
And the next day, you're giving me faces
And I like parties, not this place
It's comin' out of my bag for you to get wasted

You like it dirty and I'm Dirty Harry
I thought we were some love birds, canaries, word to Larry
But I can't fuck with you
You put my love on the line and then hang up on you
That's a long kiss goodbye, I gotta tongue kiss you
And when doves cry, we ain't got enough tissue

Where the love at?

Over Now Lyrics
I don't really care if your tears fall down your face
You know you play the victim every time
I know you gettin' turnt every night, oh yeah
Your girls ain't shit, tryna get me off your mind
The same ones who be hittin' up my line
They're not your friends
I need you to know that
We ain't ever gonna go back
This time, it got so bad
It's best for me, it's best for you
I need you to know that
Tried to love you, but I forced that

Every Angel is Terrifying Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, woah
Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' order?
Even if they pressed me against their heart, I’d be consumed

While we stand and wonder, we're annihilated
Every angel is terrifying

Don’t Break My Heart Lyrics
Ooh 
Ooh
Ooh 
I see you drowning in the purple lights
Diamonds shinin' bright
I see every 
ice
 on you
You snatch my soul, I'm crucified
I feel paralyzed
I'm so mesmerized by you 
But I know you're right for me
Ecstasy
I keep coming back for more
I think that you would die for me
Destiny
And this time, I know for sure
Just don't break my heart 
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart 
I don't know if I can take it anymore

Enemy
I kept coming back for more
I'd rather you would die for me
Destiny
And this time, I know for sure
Just don't break my heart 
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart 
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart 
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart 
I don't know if I can take it anymore
I believe the liquor's talking
I just need the room to stop and
I could be the one you want
Just as long as you don't break my heart
And I realized
When I kissed your neck
That the room is hot
I can taste your sweat
It's just you and I
In the discotheque
But don't you worry
Just don't break my heart 
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart 
I don't know if I can take it anymore

A Tale By Quincy Lyrics
That's it
Looking back now, I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, you don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that I could with them because
They know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best I could
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
I didn't
I will never forget watching my mother get put in a straightjacket
And taken out of my home when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
Leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother Lloyd
I latеr had an evil stepmother who furthеr cemented the idea that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long lasting influence I didn't fully understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships with family and those I had become romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially based on fear
But it was also totally subconscious
Looking back is a bitch, isn't it?

Starry Eyes Lyrics
I only met you in my dreams before
When I was young and alone in the world
You were there when I needed someone
To call my girl
And now you're my reality
And I wanna feel you close
But you're defeated, baby
Broken, hurtin', sufferin' from a shattered soul
Oh woah, a shattered soul
Oh, oh-oh
Let me be there
Let me be there for your heart
Let me be there
I can be there 'til you're whole
You weren't touched by a man in so long
'Cause the last time, it was way too strong
Let me be there
Let me be there for your heart
Let me love you
Let me love you like you need
And I'll make it
Make it my responsibility
I'll be there every step of the way, uh
I'll get you back on your feet
Let me love you
Let me love you like you need
And you can kick me
Kick me to the curb
It's okay, baby
I promise that I felt worse
Back then, I was starry eyed
And now I'm so cynical
Baby, break me
Kick me to the curb
Oh woah
Mm-mm

To my fans
I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy.
Because I am a man of few words,
 I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand.
 
I usually don't like to "spoon feed" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same.
 
The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground.
 
The girl holding on represents you
. 
As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest .
 
The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground.
 Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist.
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means,
 
and I made sure of that in my deal.
 You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. 
I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to 
Trilogy
. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint.
Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye 
XO

Yeah, live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again

Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore

Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it

Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless

If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low, mane
You know me 
You know me 
You know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me
Young, young nigga, same OG, stayin' lowkey
Stand ten toes deep, roll fleeces
G says, made a thesis, I'm a G
I'm a weakness like The Weeknd, so the remix...
I beg your pardon? It's true
The rumors that they start could make us break apart
Assumin' it influenced, all this sudden change of heart
Divorce in court and take off with the whole thing
'Mind 'em that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith I'd prolly walk around all day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the whip around my old ways
'Mind them that they know me
'Cause you know me 
You know me 
You know me 
You know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me 

Scenes
T
he title, "M A N I A", appears in bold, red capital letters.
Murphy the leopard is in the center of an arena-like area. 
A white light is flashing to the beat of the song. Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth.
Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song.
 There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running. 
Abel continues singing along to "Sidewalks" in his expensive vehicle.
 Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance.
There is ambience in the background. Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, 
gets out of his P1.
 He walks into the nightclub. "Secrets" begins to play and Abel sings along. Everybody in the club is dancing. There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her.
Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another. A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy. The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest. The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink. He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere. 
The music stops and Murphy roars.
Abel is covered in blood. The man lays dead on the floor, still bleeding. 
The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit. She pr
esumably saved Abel fro
m being knifed.
 The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song  as it plays in the background.
 Cut to flashing blue lights.
Abel is singing to the track.
 
Him and his girl are seen stood where Murphy the leopard was sat in the area from the first scene.

They rode through the town like it's

Drop a few hits then I lay low 
Ever since I been single, my side chick wanna be main chick

I’m a Virgin Lyrics
Had a lot of girls in my day
Wanted more from me
But there's only really one way
To start a family
And I know you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you
I'm a virgin 
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person 
Tryna act super tough
But inside I'm a twelve-year-old boy
I see you lookin' in a strong way
But I won't give it up
Supermodels, they were all fake
'Cause I never humped
And I know you, I know you want to
But I'm man enough to say to you

'Cause I'm terrified
And I know you, you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you
I'm a virgin 
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person 
You wanna hold hands then sign me up
But just know you're not gonna score
I'm a virgin 
Never got close enough
Pure as a dove, and I'm waiting
For the right person
Never once been touched
The power of God in my loins

But, ask me if I do this everyday you know
I'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know
Trade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know
I'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know

She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often
Freakier than freaky, 
when she climax she make pee pee
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin'
Long eyelashes, palmin' her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often

Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it

Need some cure for this disease
I’ve been cursed with L.U.V
My visions bleed, my memories, of all the times we spent
Now I’m left with only me, and my body’s feeling weak
I can’t believe I didn’t see, this moment come so fast
You’ve been swimming through my veins, veins, veins
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space
Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away
I let your soul inside of me, and your pain refuse to leave
It’s hard to breathe when memories refuse to fade away
Won’t stop when you shut the door, all my life never think you'd go... go
You’ve been swimming through my veins, veins, veins
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space
Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away

From paying for my sins
And I been walking this earth
Long enough that death's a gift
 
Been living this life so patient
Until I see you again, it's war we're facin'
I know that if I die, 
my only choice is still defending
No matter what they say
My love for you is greater than their powers
And their armies from above
You give me strength
I'm with you either way
If I die, if I stay
Give me strength
I'm with you either way

Just give me strength
The scars and the wounds
I wear them proud like tattoos
Rеminds me that I lost you
Reminds me that I'll bе

Then they take us to they rooms
In they birthday suit
Take it all off
I don't wanna see you baby in those draws
 
We can make a movie
We can rate it R
I can bring the camera
Baby, you can be the star

Follow the sound of Onra
Back to the party
Don't crash the car
We back to the jam
Back, back to the jam
Our summer things comin'
Baby put away the cam

Take Me Back Lyrics
I've been manipulated a hundred times, but
None of them felt so soft and kind, and
Hell is a place for what we tried, but
Never felt so wrong in my mind, and
Never understood why 
Mama cried
, and
Could it be because our secret's hiding?
I always thought someday you'd find us, but
Waiting for you is like slowly dying
'Cause you kept me warm
You held me close until you let me go
Now my blood is cold
I never had the time to let you know
Take me back, take me back
Takе me back
Take me back, takе me back
Take me back
All of me, take all of me
All of me, all of me
Take me back, take me back
Take me back

Where do we go from here?
Hold my heart and set me free
Where do we go from here?
Kiss me with each melody
Someone I used to fear
'Cause I loved your forbidden touch
The thought of you cut so deep
So I'll open up my scars
'Cause it keeps me warm
Just hold me close, I'll never let you go
'Cause now my blood is cold
I'm waiting for the day you call my phone
Take me back, take me back
Take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back
All of me, take all of me
All of me, all of me
Take me back, take me back
Take me back

False Idols Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & 
Suzanna Son
]
Be careful with who you call a God
I can't go without my pole and my rod
Sipped a cup and then I nod
Made a hundred million, must be good at my job
I done made it out the land of the brave
I can tell you shake my hands that it's fake
Free the guys, the ones who never made a statement
Slidin' with a drac', I made it home safe
Baseball numbers on all of my contracts
Billionaires buddies, they all in my contacts
I get you hit on GP, they want nothin' back
Made twenty million last month, tryna run it back 
Watches over like a God
It goes down, I'm the one thеy gon' blame
Gotta leave, whеre my soul, how I came
I know it look lit when I'm rockin' these chains
But I went through a lot for this money and fame
For this money and fame
I did a lot to get here? No comment
I put a lot in my ear, both of 'em
The 'Rari is fast as it gets, hold on
I'm 'bout to take off, bear with me
I don't wanna beef with you niggas
My beef with the system, big bro at the end of his habeas
I talk to him daily, I told him he still comin' home
I just hope he don't think I'm just sayin' shit
The money keeps comin', the feelin' is great
I pay eight-figure taxes, no more section eight
I was workin' my wrist tryna see what it take
Made a thirty do sixty, the feeling's amazing
Now I can charge by the hour
A sixty minutes set, they pay me a million, that's crazy
My diamonds really be diamonds, no shade
I'm goin' all in, no stoppin', okay

Be careful who you call a God
L.A filled with fake prophecies
They hate it when you get on top
Magazines tarnish legacies
Can you tell me, how much do they cost?
A hundred mill' ain't a stretch for me
Packin' stadiums 'cause I'm a star
Bots can't buy box seats
If you ain't down, you an enemy
I got followers that'll kill for me
And they linin' up like a DMV
With the finest girls that you've ever seen
She from California, she's sober lite
Diet Coke with the coke diet
She ride my face till my stash white
She got Chrome Hearts on with the black attire
My niggas roll with the chrome and the heavy metal
Talkin' guns, no roses, it ain't Coachella
I'm a good fella, I'm a good fella
Johnny Depp with the blow, I'm a good fella
I'm in paradise, I'm in paradise
But these false idols got me terrified
I'm so terrified, I feel terrified
Life is war in the face of God
We still walkin' with the cameras off
She a femme fatale, she's a superstar
Even down to the way that she breakin' hearts
She ain't actin', I'm not an actor
'Cause reality's, what I'm after
Real emotions, I'm tryna capture
Suck my soul up like the rapture
Don't remember my lines, but I'll cut up these lines
Rumors that you heard about me is right
Even startin' to believin' all their lies
I'm even startin' to believin' all their lies
So terrified in this paradise
I'm so terrified, oh

Die for It Lyrics
La vie n’est pas toujours facile
Elle est faite de hauts et de bas
I was told that it was Heaven
I was told that it was there before
I was told that you would never leave, ooh
And I was told that it was said before
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
I'll die for it
I remember sleepin' on floors and missin' tours, I was rock bottom
Money on my head, that was top dollar
Had to stockpile gunpowder for the Rottweilers 
I was home with pops when the cops got him 
Voices in my head, tryna kill the noise
They killed Nip, we'll never fill the void
I know the devil cried a tear of joy
Look, I know the devil cried a tear of joy 
I never tell but you heard the stories
I can never tell, is this Heaven, Hell or Purgatory? 
Early mornin' ain't early for me, I'm losin' sleep
Whole lotta sheep, I'ma count them each but fuck it, I been up late
I been gettin' twisted, I been mixin' up the love-hate
Swear this shit is glitchin', I been missin' for a month straight
Lost faith but I'ma die for it
I'ma win, I just hope that I'm alive for it

How much money will it cost us?
Feds, bounty hunters at the office, lookin' for some of our artists
We just tryna help 'em out, so they can change the outcome
Instead of puttin' pain in the street, they makin' albums
Changin' they surroundin', hopefully housin'
Smokin', we lounging in Boca Raton
Not a cloud in the sky, ocean from Mars shit
You can die a legend in your own right
Or die a street legend if it's on sight
I get so lost in my thoughts, powerful
Things I would die for, everything I built for twenty years
Won't allow you to make that crumble
Put you in the ground, I would catch a case for Jungle
And lean through the window, extendo, to clean you up
Rest in peace to Kiing Shooter
A foundation as such kids could stand
For respect, for my name, for the fam
If this is what it is then I'll die for it
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it
If this is what it is then I'll die for it
I'll die for it, said I'll die for it
I'll die for it, said I'll die for it

Don't waste your tears on me

I can love you for the night, baby
Baby, I could play your role-play
I can tell that you're the only one

Hold you down, never slip up, like Derif Jackson

A Lesser Man Lyrics
What you don't even know
I'm a deadbeat man, never know when to fold
Spent a lot for your soul
You gon' make that back, I'ma take what I own
Far away from my home
In this hot-ass town, but my blood's still cold and
Better let them know
When you see them that you make sure they pay you
Pay you in cash
I don't do favors
I don't do that
You don't want to see me
See me get mad
No matter how bad you
You think I am, am
I'm a lesser man, a lesser man
A lesser man than you think I am
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm a lesser man, you're the best of them
Fuck the rest of them
I'm a lessеr man, ah
Ah, than you know
You might also like
Show the world what I know
How you work that tongue to collect thеir souls and
Seen you do it before
Make them fall in love, make them beg for more and
You can put on a show
You're my one top star, you're my bottom girl and
Before you kiss 'em and go
Don't leave until you make sure they pay you
Pay you in cash
I don't do favors
I don't do that
You don't want to see me
See me get mad
No matter how bad you
You think I am, am
I'm a lesser man, a lesser man
A lesser man than you think I am
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm a lesser man, you're the best of them
Fuck the rest of them
I'm a lesser man, ah
Ah, than you know
A lesser man than you think I am
A lesser man than you think I am, I am, am
I think you should know, darlin'

Family Lyrics
Arms like the branches of a poplar tree
Eyes like the ocean, like the great big blue sea
Love just like my mother's, a price, it's not free
Hoo-ooh, mm
Voice like my father's, when he screams, the house shakes
Dreams like my brother's, oh, we pray for his sake
Hopes just like my mother's, oh, they last 'til her wake
Ooh, ah, ooh
That's my family
Oh, we don't like each other very much
Oh, I'm okay with that
But it breaks my mother's heart
Ah, ooh
Ah-ooh
That's my family
When I'm alone, that's when I feel the safest
Don't like being touched
Please don't give me a hug

But now I can't even feel the breeze
And it hurts when I think about
The night we went up so loud
My voice cracking when we scream
We scream, wе scream
And I watched as you wiped your еyes
And I learned to cover mine
And that's when I realized
That I figured that I'm by myself
Myself, myself

Dollhouse Lyrics
[Verse 1: Lily-Rose Depp,

Somewhere
In some other lifetime
I roam free
Strutting down my own lane, my way, no kings, no slaves
But right now
You got me in a chokehold, headlock, blindfold, don't stop
Keep me in the dollhouse, dressed up, perfect, messed up
Just prop me with my head high
 (
Oh woah
)
[Chorus: Lily-Rose Depp, 
The Weeknd

Dollhouse, dressed up, perfect, messed up
Torture me to sleep, paint the air I breathe
Fishbowl, chokehold, clеar water, I'm cold (
Oh woah
)
Perfect as can bе, have your way with me
[Verse 2: Lily-Rose Depp, 
The Weeknd

Somewhere
On some other timeline
There's no price on me (
Oh
)
Nothing to compete with, pray for, no games, no war
I lay down
Every night at sunset, glowing, fairytale, knowing
Every day will be perfectly complete
Happy ever after, gleaming, daytime, dreaming
Once upon a time, in my brand new life
You will find me with my head high

I try to always do right

You never gave up on me 
I'll never know what you see 
I don't do well when alone 
You hear it clear in my
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need 
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down 
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust

Creepin’  Lyrics
Yeah, thought you'd never leave me (
Just can't believe this, man
)

Bad Boy
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
[Verse 2: The Weeknd, 
Diddy
]
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know (
Ayo, comе on
)
They ain't real, then thеy ain't Puff
Ain't a place in this world that my feet ain't touch
I got visions that cost millions and make billions
Baby girl, we can make love and make trillions
Damn, baby, you my curse and my crush
I'd walk to the ends of the earth for your touch
Ride for you, cry for you, 
die for you
Never gon' say, "Goodbye," to you
Never lie to you
Life ain't perfect, we just live it
Fuck what they say we did, we just did it
I'm the DeLeón sipper
, bad bitch getter
With the top down, screamin' out, "Fuck them niggas"

The toughest of my life so far
I've tried to feel cheer
I'm further than the Northern Star
So when you ask me
What I want under the tree
I just want you with me
'Cause if I didn't have you
When the snow is fallin'
On that winter mornin'
I'd have Christmas blues
If I didn't have you
When everyone's unwrappin'
No matter what I open
I'd have Christmas blues

She drive five hours for a nigga just to get some long dick
No flowers from her nigga out in Luxembourg
She came to Paris for a nigga
She want to introduce her parents to a nigga, shit
I just came from Milan, I had a threesome with two white bitches
Almost had a four but the black girl didn't even like bitches
I let her suck the dick, and passed her to my nigga
Bunch of bad bitches in Geneva
Twenty bottles in the club on my Visa
Smokin' like a Taylor at my table, uh
It's Pushaz Inc., the motherfuckin' label, and that XO
All my niggas on they think, we sold our souls to the devil
Local niggas say that, tell 'em to first get on my level
Out in Bern in the coupe slidin'
With a bitch, 'bout to get it poppin'
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it

Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up

But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land

Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me

Best Friends  Lyrics
Oh, what we got
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart
Things you want, I'm not lookin' for
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now
Oh, I love it when we climax
And I would never burn you
I could never hurt you
If we do it like that
Don't try to take it further
Focus on the friendship
Get a little sidetracked
Catchin' little feelings
Thought we had arrangements
Thought you weren't like that
Yeah , I thought you weren't like that
Oh, friends no more
Sеx as friends no more

For Your Eyes Only Lyrics
Medicate my soul with your lips, I need
I need to forget that my love's at peace
With another man who respects and treats
Treats her with a trust, and honesty
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
Make me come alive, I just want to breathe
I've been up for days, I just want to sleep
Please relieve the stress, got me on my knees
So heal me with your warmth, give yourself to me
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again

And she hide all the demons with her makeup
Painting lies all on her face

I've been patient
About this situation
And don't you worry
About your heart breakin'

But this part you do on your own, your own
I said, I'll never leave you alone
But this part you do on your own, your own
Yeah, I'll never leave you alone
But this part you do on your own, by yourself, baby

Oh, lo
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Better try me
Don't you mess with me
Don't you mess with me
The way I kissed your scars
The way I fixed your heart, oh
Don't you miss me, babe?
Don’t you miss me, baby?

Everything I said I'd do, I did
Oh yeah, come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Oh yeah, uh
But baby, let's face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
Just put it in a ponytail, fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, panties to the side
Put the panties to the side, like a don do
Get it wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got hoes, got cribs
Got niggas that'll die for a prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach, came back in a jet
Come through, I'm not living like I did before
Come through, um, I said come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Come through, oh yeah
Oh, come through
I've been out there puttin' down that work
Come through, oh yeah, I said come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Come through, come through, ohh

I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet, I'll get on it after former
More sections of this yak on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' roll, but I fuckin' roll
Feelin' like a million bucks before
I walk through this door, when I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it, but I made it, that's for sure
For sure, your lovin', I need more, I need yours
She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on? They want what I'm sippin' on
They don't want my love, they just want my potential
Fuck it, I'll keep sippin' on this, baby livin' off of this
Got me drownin' in your love, you got me drownin' in abyss
Give me wet attention, I'll start drowning from my wrists, wrist
And baby if you need a little more
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

After Hours  Lyrics
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you 
I turned into the man I used to be
To be 
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me 
I just wanted to call you and say, and say 
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most? 
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

While I want everybody to see through love
Oh, thank you all the time
Take me through the night
XO
I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a dozen cups of different colored potions
All I wanna do is get that money and make dope shit
Niggas they recruiting always sounding like my old shit
Everybody knows it, all you nigga know me
All you nigga , call me little homie
Faded off of codeine, rolling till my nose bleed
Hitting off of nothing while I blow through that OG

Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix

Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices 
And if she wanna fuck my niggas, she got choices

I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait till I fall out of love
Won't you call out my—
I'm a, I'm a starboy
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid, oh
You talking about me, I don't see the shade
I witch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done, oh baby, why?
Why? Cause I'm a, I'm a, I'm a starboy
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Said look what you’ve done, look what you'vе done, look what you’ve done
I'm a, I'm a starboy
Hey, hey, hey
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Said look what you’ve done, look what you've done, look what you’ve done
I'm a, I'm a starboy
Your man on the road, he doing promo
You said, “Keep our business on the low-low”
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me
Hey
Half-past five, baby
 love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me, babe
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, girl, I know
She told me, “don't worry about it”
She told me, “don't worry, no more”
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, “you'll never be alone”, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you 
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you 
But I love it, but I love it, oh
Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush, girl, when you're alone
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
You make it look like it's magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to bein' used
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'm a care for you, you, you
I'm a care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah
On that lonely night 
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush 
It made us believe it was only us 
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah

Oh, this is fun, fun, fun, fun 
Fun, fun, fun, fun 
Fun, fun, fun, fun 
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just calling back to let you know
I could never say it on the phone
Will never let you go this time
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

All a kid needs is a girl with a dream
A girl like you, with no insecurities
Don't be ashamed if you all about the game
That’s what I'm tryna fuck, that's what I’m tryna chase
I like it when you take this money, girl, money, girl, it's all for you
Just tryna see you out that shirt
I brought money to throw for you, lets go
All a nigga needs is some good ass weed
And the bass real loud 'til my eardrums bleed
And if I give you a task, you'll do what I say
And you'll do what I say with a smile on your face
And you'll serve this royalty
Believing in me, know, you gotta serve this royalty right
And trust what I'm saying, we can get it

Why do I hold it on tight?
How do I show you what's good?
How do I put my lips into your skin?

Save Your Tears  Lyrics
Yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room, uh
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away 
I make you cry when I run away 
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
You might also like
I made you think that I would always stay, yeah
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away , oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl
I said save your tears for another day
Tears for another day
Girl, I said save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

Call Out My Name  Lyrics
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? 
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You might also like
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently 
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name 
Girl, call out my name and I'll be on my way
Girl, I'll be on my—
On my way, all the way
On my way, all the way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way

To my fans
I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have.
 No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy
Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The 'Rolling Stone' video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest . The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. 
I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to
 '
Trilogy
'. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint
Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XO

I lost a friend today
Feel you gone, gone, you slipped away
Here you'll always stay with me
The moments shared, the memories as I dream
I look for you, I reminisce
These empty nights I call out to you, feelin' for you
Crazy love comes to an end
Another thought, a picture of you, dreamin' of you
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
My, ooh

I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but
I sacrificed 
Your love for more of the night 
I try to put up a fight 
Can't tie me down

Scared To Live  Lyrics
When I saw the signs, I should've let you go
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we've lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left
They just made you feel lonely 
Well, I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart

So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
Woah-oh-woah
So don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that

Sun is never rising
I don't know if it's day or night
Blacken my horizon
I'm running out of time
Are you real, or are you an illusion?
Cause I feel your love's my delusion
Wake me up
, come find me
It feels like I'm dying
Wake me up, these demons
Keep breathing, don't be it
Wake me up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's coming to the wire
I'm feeling like I'm paralyzed
Cleanse me with your fire
Open up my eyes
Are you real, or are you an illusion?
Cause I feel your love's my delusion

Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Call me up, I'mma turn it to a faucet
Duffle bags full of— and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target

Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down 
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

You bring good to my lonely life, honestly 
It's hard for me to look into your eyes

I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place , yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions

We always joke, but you can tell when you look me in my eyes
That I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babe
That I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babe
Come to my city, I like to say, I'm living pretty nice

Oh, oh, oh, said 
But I showed that I got it all for you
Save you love, where 
And rewire all your thoughts
...
And break, break your little cold heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Call me up and I'll send f'you
Take me down to where you 
I don't know if I can go to home...

Ehh, ehh, uh
Take a spliff with the homies while we're waiting for a
Couple of women who be down to trip 
 While trippin' off their faces
This molly got us zombie, got me feeling all sedated
White girl loving
With a van full of hippies
Who love us, so lovely
They didn't even hesitate to touch us
They love us, so we lust them
No one will catch them
No one can help them
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
Yeah, I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo 
Echo

And if you know me well, I don't like to talk

All on my skin, you all in my palm
I sent you an envelope, came with a poem
You possess venom, that came with a charm
You get the good out me when I perform
I know the bad in you, that's just what I want
And you a baddie, you turnin' me on
Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin'
Love when you fuckin', we talkin', I know what you doin'
Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'?
Bottles and bottles what else there ain't to it
I tell you "I got you", that's well understood
Your legs on the bed, got your head on the floor
We go out shoppin' whenever we get bored
We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store
If I go to Saturn, I know that you goin'
Fuck me on Saturday, early in the mornin'
Flyer than a bird, she gon' open her door
Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse
Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support
Stars in the ceilin', don't feel like a Porsche
Came from the trenches, just livin' at war
Once was a prostitute, I can afford you
The one I adore
Temperature risin', bodies united
Now that I trapped you in my arms
No need to fight it, no need to hide it
Now that I see what's in your heart
Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you
And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you
Even though it's wrong

I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know
You know the words
Let's go, one, two, three, say
Even though we're goin' through it

My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down
I was running away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' monеy to compensate, compensatе

You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city, I'm a young God
That pussy kill be so vicious
My God white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
Asked me if I do this every day, I said 
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way 
Baby, I can make that pussy rain 
Talk to 'em
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Well, guess what, LA?

 I said 
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way 
Baby, I can make that pussy rain 
I said
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it

Lyrics from Snippet
I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
...time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she don't want to drink 'cause she know I might like it 
And she gon' roll it up 'cause she know I might like it 
She gon' show me love 'cause she know I might like it 
Baby girl, you know what I like 
Baby, you know just what I likе
 Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like
Don't be mad, let her get hers 
Don't be mad, let her get hers 
Make her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, we just getting started, Los Angeles, come on!

Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your, let's go
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny piеces
Then she clеan it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Every day, a nigga try to end me, yah
Pull off in that Roadster SV
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now, she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, so let's

I'm lookin' at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M
I'm trying not to lose my faith

You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm ****, that's the real me

The only time I'd еver call you mine

We're goin' back in time

Unpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mind

And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality

I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said
Los Angeles, welcome to the After Hours 'til Dawn Tour

Is it the left side or the right side?
Let's find out
Left side, left side, left side, left side, left side, left side, left side, left side

She wants to be friends with the crew
Take a lot of pics and travel where we move
Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear
20,000 fans get jealous up in here
They don't even care, girl, give it a rest
Ain't no fucking pussy gonna stick out from the rest
Girls with big breasts ain't shit without leg
'Least in my books so put me through this test, I could care less
Penelope Cruz, Natalie Portman, please holla at your dude
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Don't you forget it, girls like Gia, girls with no visas
Addicted to the life, french girls named Mia
Cause my chick might be the next Keira Knightley

Talk if you want, talk if you want

Bad intentions you bring
No religion that you follow
Still you bullshit for boys in love
You're so blind to see that enough is enough
I don't concern myself too much
I'll awake when my time is arrived
When all is said and done
Tonight well
I can't feel my heart
Cause you leach off to many hearts
Well it's safe to say
That I've had enough of troubled thoughts in my mind
I should try to pray for my demise, ohhh-ohh
What's the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall
Tell me what you see in this mirror that you're lookin', baby
You're so ashamed, I see it in the look in your eyes
You're afraid, I wanna show you what's inside of you
Let me enter your brain now
Pardon me, I only see your reflection, but you
Best believe this is a fuckin' test of
What you do, oh you know what you do
I'ma let you solve your own clues
Baby the hardest part is the will to come in
I know you lost respect for me
Say that you did
Could you give me one last kiss
So I could learn to feel again
Make me regret everything that I've done
And love again, love again

I can do is love you one last time
Just to recollect memories in our mind
When everything is done don't act like you know me so well
I'll just be someone that you used to know

You want me, but he needs you
Yet you're tellin' me that everything's cool
Tryin' to convince me, to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way

Nobody has to know, has to know
Not your momma, not your sister, not your daddy

This I know , yeah, girl, I know
'Cause now I'm dancin' in the dark
Got a spot down on fifth street
Drinkin' whiskey at the bar, got some random guy with me
And he doesn't know my name, but he thinks that I'm pretty
Oh, I swear, I'm never gonna drink again
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it

The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life 
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby 
I look back now and I realize
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time
If he mess up just a little 
Baby, you know my line 
If you don't trust him a little

Give me one chance, just a little

Trust Issues Lyrics
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well, babygirl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one, uh
Oh girl, I'm on one, uh
Fuck it, I popped one
I popped one
Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?
I'm on eviction number two
'Cause I popped one, oh
Fuck it, I popped one

I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well
I'm not a fool 
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool 
I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel 
When nobody ever would 
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
Oooh, girl , I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world 
And oooh, girl , I wanna embrace you 
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby
I'm not a fool 
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool,

In the case of Meek Mill, things have gone from bad to worse ever since he took Drake on. Everything he has tried since then appears to blow up in his face. At one point, there were rumors of Jay Z trying to step in and help his Roc Nation management artist.
Clearly, not even the influence of Jay Z can save Meek Mill from the backlash he is facing.
 
Then, there are his social media antics that the fans simply cannot understand. The latest comes after The Weeknd got his girlfriend, Nicki Minaj, on the remix of his record.
A tweet, supposedly from Meek Mill’s Twitter, made some brash comments about The Weeknd.
 
As everyone knows, The Weeknd is one of the oldest artists on Drake’s OVO label.
 
After seeing their performance, Meek Mill reportedly tweeted that The Weeknd has a tree on his head, which could have been made up. This leads up to why this controversy has been reported.

One-night stand 'cause I’m toxic 
We don't go on dates, I'm tryna duck the paparazzi 
Pull it out and put it in a face like it’s Hibachi 
You know I'm a dog, you probably better off without me
Diamonds on my body, I'm a hockey puck 
Lil' mama been around the hood, like the ice cream truck 
I ain't leavin' you for dead, come get your life cleaned up
Still can't put a ring on her, she a nice ting but—
You can come and join the team, I got cap space 
Whole pointers on the bezzel, call it Fat Face 
A-Rod, I'm ballin', but I'm loyal, never leave the base
You can call me anythin' you want but just don’t call me Bae 
Put her to the test and she was here to stay 
Fall asleep on FaceTime when I'm awake 
She addicted to the game, and she know I play
If you tryna find another me, then you gon' have to pray
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Another one of me won't come around again, uh

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah 
You might also like
I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you, uh
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
